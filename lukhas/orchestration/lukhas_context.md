- Cross-pillar workflow orchestration and decision coordination
- Trinity Framework state management and consistency enforcement
- Multi-system integration with unified orchestration patterns

#### **Cross-System Integration** - CANDIDATE-LUKHAS-PRODUCTS Bridge
- Development-to-production workflow orchestration and coordination
- Cross-system state synchronization and data consistency management
- Integration pipeline orchestration and deployment coordination
- Multi-environment workflow management and promotion processes

#### **Production Orchestration** - Enterprise-Grade Coordination
- Production workflow orchestration with enterprise reliability
- High-availability orchestration with failover and recovery
- Performance-optimized orchestration with minimal latency
- Enterprise monitoring and observability integration
