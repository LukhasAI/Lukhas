# Jules-10 — MCP Operational Support Implementation

**Priority**: HIGH
**File**: `ai_orchestration/lukhas_mcp_server.py`
**Line**: 34

## Goal
Implement operational support tools and analysis capabilities for LUKHAS MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration.

## Requirements
- Operational monitoring system
- Analysis tool integration
- Support workflow automation
- Performance optimization

## Steps
1. **Analyze existing MCP server structure** in `lukhas_mcp_server.py:34`
2. **Implement operational support core**:
   ```python
   class LUKHASMCPOperationalSupport:
       def monitor_mcp_operations(self, server_context: MCPServerContext) -> OperationalMetrics:
           """Monitor MCP server operations and performance."""

       def analyze_operational_patterns(self, metrics_history: List[OperationalMetrics]) -> AnalysisResult:
           """Analyze operational patterns for optimization opportunities."""

       def automate_support_workflows(self, incident: SupportIncident) -> WorkflowResult:
           """Automate common support workflows and incident response."""
   ```
3. **Add operational monitoring**:
   - Real-time MCP server health monitoring
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error rate tracking and alerting
   - Resource utilization analysis
4. **Implement analysis tools**:
   - Operational pattern analysis
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Predictive maintenance capabilities
   - Optimization recommendation engine
5. **Create support automation**:
   - Automated incident response
   - Self-healing mechanisms
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - Performance tuning workflows
6. **Add operational dashboard and reporting**

## Commands
```bash
# Test MCP operational support
python -c "from ai_orchestration.lukhas_mcp_server import LUKHASMCPOperationalSupport; print('Available')"
pytest -q tests/ -k mcp_operational
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Operational monitoring system functional
- [ ] Analysis tools integrated and working
- [ ] Support workflow automation implemented
- [ ] Performance optimization active
- [ ] Operational dashboard available
- [ ] Automated incident response tested

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with existing LUKHAS monitoring systems
- Implement robust error handling and recovery
- Document operational procedures clearly
- Consider multi-server deployment scenarios
- Add comprehensive logging and audit trails

## Trinity Aspect
**🛡️ Guardian**: Operational support and monitoring for MCP server infrastructure
