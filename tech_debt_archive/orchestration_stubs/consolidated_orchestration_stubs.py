"""
Archived Orchestration Service Stubs
====================================

These are consolidated stub classes that were never implemented.
Moved from consciousness/reflection/orchestration_service.py on 2025-08-12
for tech debt cleanup.

These represent potential future functionality but are not currently
functional and can be safely archived.

Classes archived:
- VisionaryMode
- ConsciousnessLevel  
- VisionaryMetrics
- AdaptiveOrchestrator
- TracebackType
- TracebackDepth
- TracebackNode
- TracebackResult
- RecursiveCollapseLineageTracker
- OrchestrationMode
- ProcessingLevel
- LukhasTier
- ConsciousnessState
- TierCapabilities
- OrchestrationMetrics
- LukhasOrchestrator
- OptimizationStrategy
- PerformanceStatus
- PerformanceMetrics
- OptimizationResult
- PerformanceOrchestrator
- MessageType

- OrchestrationCoreBridge
- OrchestratorArchiver
- DuplicateRemover
- TestModularIntelligenceOrchestrator
- MockModule
- OrchestratorCore
- ZKProofStub
- OrchestrationEntityActivator
- AdaptiveUI
- QuorumOrchestrator

Reason for archival: These are empty stub classes with only TODO comments.
They represent potential future architecture but have no current implementation
and are blocking code maintainability.

If any of these classes are needed in the future, they can be re-implemented
based on actual requirements rather than as consolidated stubs.
