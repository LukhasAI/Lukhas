# Symbolic Bridge

This module contains the core components for the Symbolic Bridge, which facilitates communication and data flow between different consciousness nodes in the LUKHAS distributed consciousness system.

## Guardian Integration

The `BridgeTokenMap` class is integrated with the Guardian system to provide ethical validation of consciousness flows. This ensures that token mappings do not violate the ethical policies defined in the system.

### Features:

- **Ethical Validation**: All token mappings are validated against a set of predefined policies.
- **Configurable**: The Guardian system can be enabled or disabled through configuration.
- **Validation History**: A history of all validation attempts is maintained and can be queried.
- **Status Reporting**: The status of the Guardian system, including the number of validations and violations, can be retrieved.
