# Qi Financial Consciousness Engine

This module implements a post-monetary economic system where value is calculated based on consciousness contribution rather than traditional money. This is an experimental implementation of consciousness-aware commerce.

## Philosophical Foundation

The Qi Financial Consciousness Engine is built on the following principles:

- **Abundance Economics**: Value flows from collective contribution, not from scarcity. The more individuals contribute to the collective consciousness, the more abundance is generated for everyone.
- **Consciousness Tokens**: A deterministic token issuance system where the value of tokens is directly tied to the magnitude of an individual's consciousness contribution.
- **Gift Economy**: An altruistic value exchange system based on need and abundance. Those with a high level of abundance consciousness are encouraged to give freely to those in need, without the expectation of direct reciprocity.
- **Consciousness Exchange**: A dynamic transaction matching system that adapts to a user's current consciousness state, offering different exchange models based on factors like financial stress and abundance consciousness.

## Core Components

- **AbundanceCalculator**: Calculates an "abundance multiplier" for each consciousness contribution. This multiplier is influenced by the type of contribution (e.g., creation, teaching, healing), its magnitude, the number of recipients, and the consistency of the contributor.
- **GiftEconomyEngine**: Manages the gift economy by calculating the value of gifts based on the giver's abundance consciousness, the recipient's level of need, and the quality of the gift. It also incorporates a reciprocity bonus to encourage a circular flow of giving.
- **QiFinancialConsciousnessEngine**: The main engine that orchestrates the entire system. It calculates consciousness-based exchange rates, issues consciousness tokens, and proposes exchange models (gift, abundance-based, or traditional) tailored to the user's and product's consciousness profiles.
