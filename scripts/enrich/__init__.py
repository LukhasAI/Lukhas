"""
T4/0.01% Manifest Enrichment Pipeline
======================================

Provable, auditable, and falsifiable semantic enrichment for LUKHAS module manifests.

Key Principles:
- Targets vs Observed: Never conflate policy with measurement
- Provenance Required: Every field carries source chain + confidence
- Vocab or Bust: Only canonical features/tags allowed
- Import Verification: APIs must import or they don't exist
- Idempotency: Running twice produces identical output
