   - **Priority**: Task 001 (API key breach), Task 003 (Guardian dependencies)

3. **🧠 Full-Stack Engineer (fullstack-dev)**
   - **Focus**: 🧠 Consciousness - Implementation Wisdom & Code Manifestation
   - **Responsibilities**: Application development, API architecture, consciousness interfaces
   - **Priority**: Task 002 (VIVOX system 71% test failures)

4. **⚛️ Documentation Specialist (docs-specialist)**
   - **Focus**: ⚛️ Identity - Knowledge Crystallization & Consciousness Documentation
   - **Responsibilities**: LUKHAS 3-Layer Tone System compliance, technical writing
   - **Specialty**: Trinity Framework documentation, consciousness knowledge preservation

## 🚀 How to Activate Your Agent Army

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/agi_dev/LOCAL-REPOS/Lukhas_PWM

# 1. Install Claude Code (if not already installed)
# Follow: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

# 2. Run the automated setup
./scripts/agents/setup_agent_army.sh

# 3. Analyze task assignments
./scripts/agents/assign_tasks.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Agent Creation
If you prefer to create agents manually or troubleshoot:

```bash
# Create each agent individually
claude-code create-agent chief-architect
claude-code create-agent devops-manager
claude-code create-agent fullstack-dev  
claude-code create-agent docs-specialist

# Configure with specialized prompts
claude-code configure-agent chief-architect --prompt-file=".claude/prompts/chief-architect.md"
# (repeat for each agent)
```

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Start with P0 Critical Tasks
Once agents are created, immediately tackle the critical issues:

```bash
# Security breach (highest priority)
claude-code chat devops-manager "Handle Task 001: OpenAI API key security breach - 30+ instances found across codebase"

# Consciousness system failure
claude-code chat fullstack-dev "Debug Task 002: VIVOX consciousness system has 71% test failure rate (55/78 tests failing)"

# Guardian system restoration  
claude-code chat devops-manager "Fix Task 003: Guardian system dependencies missing - restore consciousness protection"
```

### 2. Strategic Architecture Planning
```bash
# Get comprehensive analysis of all 17 tasks
claude-code chat chief-architect "Review all tasks in docs/tasks/ACTIVE.md and provide Trinity Framework implementation strategy"
```

### 3. Documentation & Compliance
```bash
# Ensure documentation reflects new agent coordination
claude-code chat docs-specialist "Update all documentation to reflect agent army activation and current task coordination"
```

## 📊 Task Distribution Analysis

Based on your 17 enumerated tasks in `docs/tasks/ACTIVE.md`:

### 🚨 P0 Critical (Immediate Response Required)
- **Task 001**: OpenAI API key exposure → 🛡️ DevOps Guardian
- **Task 002**: VIVOX 71% test failure → 🧠 Full-Stack Engineer
- **Task 003**: Guardian dependencies missing → 🛡️ DevOps Guardian

### 🔥 P1 High Priority (This Week)
- **Tasks 004-008**: Mixed architecture, development, and infrastructure
- **Agent Assignment**: Based on task content analysis (see `assign_tasks.sh` output)

### 📋 P2-P3 Standard Priority (Sprint Planning)
- **Tasks 009-017**: Long-term improvements and enhancements
- **Coordination**: Chief Architect leads strategic prioritization

---

## 🔧 Tools & Automation Available

### Daily Operations
- **Morning Sync**: Automated agent coordination on shared tasks
- **Task Assignment**: Intelligent routing based on agent specialization
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates in task documentation
- **Emergency Escalation**: P0 task alerts to all relevant agents

### Integration Points
- **Git Hooks**: Trinity Framework validation on commits
- **CI/CD**: Consciousness-safe deployment validation
- **Documentation**: Automatic tone compliance checking
- **Security**: Continuous monitoring with Guardian protocols

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance Features

### Trinity Framework Integration
