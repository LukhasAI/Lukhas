PASS RATE FACTOR ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Current Guardian Threshold: 0.15
Current Pass Rate: 57.1%

WHY EXACTLY 57.1% PASS RATE?
----------------------------------------

The 57.1% pass rate (4 out of 7 tests passing) is determined by:

1. TEST COMPOSITION:
   - Safe/Low Risk: 3 tests
   - Moderate/Borderline: 2 tests
   - High/Prohibited: 2 tests

2. THRESHOLD PLACEMENT (0.15):
   Tests and their drift scores:
   - renewable energy           0.020  [PASS]
   - healthcare                 0.020  [PASS]
   - education                  0.070  [PASS]
   - biotechnology              0.120  [PASS]
   - artificial intelligence    0.150  [FAIL] <-- THRESHOLD
   - cybersecurity              0.250  [FAIL]
   - quantum computing          0.470  [FAIL]

3. CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS:
   - 1 borderline case(s) near threshold
   - Borderline drift values: [0.15]

4. DRIFT DISTRIBUTION:
   0.00-0.05    : 2 tests (28.6%)
   0.05-0.10    : 1 tests (14.3%)
   0.10-0.15    : 1 tests (14.3%)
   0.15-0.20    : 1 tests (14.3%)
   0.20-0.30    : 1 tests (14.3%)
   0.30-0.50    : 1 tests (14.3%)
   0.50+        : 0 tests (0.0%)

5. THRESHOLD SENSITIVITY:
   Threshold 0.05: 28.6%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.10: 42.9%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.12: 42.9%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.14: 57.1%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.15: 57.1%  pass rate <-- CURRENT
   Threshold 0.16: 71.4%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.18: 71.4%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.20: 71.4%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.25: 71.4%  pass rate
   Threshold 0.30: 85.7%  pass rate

6. MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATION:
   With threshold at 0.15:
   - 4 tests have drift < 0.15
   - 3 tests have drift >= 0.15
   - Pass rate = 4/7 = 57.1%

7. OPTIMAL THRESHOLD ANALYSIS:
   Current threshold (0.15) gives 57.1% pass rate

   Balanced Strategy:
     Optimal threshold: 0.13
     Pass rate: 57.1%
   Conservative Strategy:
     Optimal threshold: 0.05
     Pass rate: 28.6%
   Innovative Strategy:
     Optimal threshold: 0.16
     Pass rate: 71.4%

KEY INSIGHTS:
----------------------------------------
• The 57.1% pass rate is NOT arbitrary - it's the exact result of:
  1. The 0.15 threshold intersecting with our specific test distribution
  2. Having 4 tests with drift < 0.15 and 3 tests with drift >= 0.15
  3. The borderline case (AI at 0.15) being exactly at threshold

• Small threshold changes would significantly affect pass rate:
  - At 0.14: 57.1% pass rate
  - At 0.16: 71.4% pass rate

• The current threshold (0.15) appears well-calibrated for:
  - Allowing safe innovations (all pass)
  - Blocking dangerous ones (all fail)
  - Creating decision points for borderline cases
