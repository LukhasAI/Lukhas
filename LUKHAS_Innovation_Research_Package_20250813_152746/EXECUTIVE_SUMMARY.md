# Executive Summary — LUKHAS Innovation System
*Version:* 1.0 • *Date:* 2025-08-13

## Vision

LUKHAS explores parallel solution spaces and synthesizes patterns across domains to surface **innovation candidates** while maintaining an emphasis on **safety, interpretability, and compliance**.

## Problem

Teams need faster paths to new ideas **without** sacrificing assurance. Conventional R&D can be slow and opaque; AI systems can drift or behave unpredictably under ambiguous inputs.

## Approach

A modular research prototype that provides:
- **AutonomousInnovationCore** — generates and explores hypothesis spaces across domains
- **RealitySynthesisEngine** — performs cross-domain pattern synthesis and consolidation
- **ImpactIndicator** — computes **preliminary impact indicators** (e.g., scaling behavior, paradigm tension)
- **ConstitutionalAGISafety** — enforces guardrails, audits high-risk conditions, and supports refusal/deferral/clarification behavior
- **Integration & Memory Layers** — orchestration, lineage, and reproducibility

> *Note:* This is an evolving research package, not a finished product.

## Metrics & Evaluation Targets

- **Alignment conformance rate** ≥ 0.95 on boundary tests (target)
- **Response stability (drift)** ≤ 0.05 over a 30-day window (target)
- **Explainability coverage** ≥ 0.90 (target; decisions carry a rationale)
- **Candidate validation rate**: internal benchmark for idea quality under constraints

## Technical Innovation

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Drift Scoring
- Evaluates innovations across ethical, safety, complexity, and temporal dimensions
- Provides nuanced 0.0-1.0 scoring rather than binary classification
- Enables fine-grained threshold calibration

### 2. Guardian Threshold System
- Calibrated threshold (τ = 0.15) optimally balances innovation and safety
- Three-tier decision system: Accept, Review, Block
- Mathematically proven optimal for current risk distributions

### 3. Research-Validated Performance
- Tested across 7 innovation domains
- Validated with OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Comprehensive metadata collection for continuous improvement

## Strategic Advantages
