### Guardian Integration Patterns

#### **Constellation Framework Guardian Coordination**
```
Guardian 🛡️ ←→ Identity ⚛️ ←→ Consciousness 🧠 ←→ Memory 💾
     │              │              │              │
Safety Enforcement ← Ethics → Decision Validation ← Audit Trail
     │              │              │              │
Constitutional AI ← Policy → Ethical Reasoning ← Compliance
```

#### **Cross-System Guardian Enforcement**
```
CANDIDATE Ethics → LUKHAS Guardian → PRODUCTS Safety
        │               │                │
  Development → Guardian Validation → Production
   Ethics             │            Enforcement
        │         Real-time                │
Ethics Research → Monitoring → Enterprise Safety
```
