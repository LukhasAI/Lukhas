# Compliance Engines Detail
## Regulatory Compliance & Policy Enforcement

### Compliance System Overview
- **Purpose**: Regulatory compliance validation and enforcement systems
- **Architecture**: GDPR/CCPA compliance engines with audit frameworks
- **Integration**: Cross-system compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Scale**: Enterprise-grade compliance with comprehensive regulatory coverage

### Core Compliance Architecture

#### **Regulatory Compliance Engines** - Multi-Jurisdiction Support
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance validation
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) enforcement systems
- SOC 2 Type II compliance monitoring and audit preparation
- Industry-specific regulatory compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX)

#### **Privacy Protection Systems** - Data Protection & Rights
- Personal data identification, classification, and protection
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") implementation
- Data portability and access request automation
- Consent management and user privacy rights enforcement

#### **Audit & Reporting** - Compliance Monitoring & Documentation
- Automated audit trail generation and compliance documentation
- Regulatory reporting automation and submission systems
- Compliance dashboard and real-time monitoring systems
- Violation detection and remediation workflow automation

#### **Policy Enforcement** - Compliance Rule Engine
- Dynamic compliance rule definition and enforcement systems
- Cross-system policy application and consistency validation
- Compliance violation detection and automatic remediation
- Policy conflict resolution and priority management systems

### Compliance Integration Patterns

#### **Constellation Framework Compliance Coordination**
```
Compliance Engine ←→ Identity ⚛️ ←→ Guardian 🛡️ ←→ Memory 💾
        │                │              │              │
   Data Protection ← Identity → Ethics → Memory Access
        │           Compliance    Validation    Controls
        │                │              │              │
   Privacy Rights ← Governance → Constitutional AI ← Audit
```

#### **Cross-System Compliance Flow**
```
CANDIDATE Compliance → LUKHAS Validation → PRODUCTS Enforcement
        │                     │                      │
  Policy Development → Compliance Testing → Production Compliance
        │                     │                      │
  Research → Integration → Enterprise Deployment
```

### Key Compliance Components

#### **Data Governance** - Data Lifecycle Management
- Data classification and sensitivity labeling systems
- Data retention policy enforcement and automated deletion
- Data lineage tracking and impact analysis systems
- Cross-border data transfer compliance and validation

#### **Consent Management** - User Consent & Preferences
- Granular consent collection and preference management
- Consent withdrawal processing and system-wide enforcement
- Cookie consent management and tracking prevention
- Third-party consent coordination and validation systems

#### **Access Controls** - Rights Management & Enforcement
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with compliance validation
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for complex scenarios
- Privileged access management (PAM) with audit trails
- Just-in-time access provisioning with compliance logging

### Compliance Development Patterns

#### **Compliance System Development Workflow**
```
Regulatory Analysis → Policy Definition → Engine Implementation
        │                   │                    │
  Requirements → Compliance Rules → Validation Systems
        │                   │                    │
  Testing → Integration → Monitoring → Reporting
```
