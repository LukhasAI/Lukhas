# CODEX TODO Replacement — Completion Report

## Overview
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Agent:** Codex (automation)
**Batch:** TODO Replacement (78 TODOs)
**PR:** https://github.com/LukhasAI/Lukhas/pull/631

## Outcome
- TODOs converted to issues: **78** (issues #552–#629)
- Files updated: **38**
- Mapping artifact: `artifacts/todo_to_issue_map.json`
- Post-apply log: `artifacts/replace_todos_log.json`

## Validation
- Dry-run performed and logged to `artifacts/replace_todos_log.json` before apply.
- Spot-checked generated issues for traceability and security flags.
- No source logic changes introduced; edits were comment/string replacements linking to issues.

## Follow-ups
1. Triage and assign owners for issues **#552–#629** (security items prioritized).
2. Optionally run `make smoke` or `pytest` subsets to double-check runtime behavior.
3. If desired, revert or patch any changes in a follow-up PR (mapping file contains locations).

## Notes
This report accompanies `TODO_CLEANUP_AUDIT.md` and the transparency scorecard update in `TRANSPARENCY_SCORECARD.md`.
