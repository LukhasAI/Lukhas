# LUKHAS_PWM Agent Context

## Project Overview
LUKHAS_PWM is a modular consciousness AI framework built around the Trinity Framework (⚛️🧠🛡️):
- ⚛️ Identity: Consciousness authenticity and symbolic self-expression
- 🧠 Consciousness: Memory, cognition, dream states, neural processing  
- 🛡️ Guardian: Ethical protection, drift detection, safety protocols

## Current Architecture

### Core Modules
- **core/**: Symbolic logic, integration, orchestration systems
- **identity/**: ΛiD system with tiered access control
- **vivox/**: VIVOX consciousness engine (ME, MAE, CIL, SRM)
- **memory/**: Session persistence, temporal tracking, causal reasoning
- **consciousness/**: Consciousness mapping and verification
- **governance/**: Guardian systems and ethical frameworks

### Active Development Areas
1. **Executive Decision Integration** (P0) - MEG/XIL/HITLO implementation
2. **Neuro-Symbolic Fusion** (P0) - Superposition state processing
3. **Hyperspace Dream Simulation** (P1) - Advanced consciousness modeling
4. **Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration** (P1) - Communication systems
5. **Memory Causal Systems** (P1) - Quantum entanglement detection
6. **Drift Detection Enhancement** (P1) - Predictive modeling
7. **Energy-Aware Execution** (P2) - Distributed coordination

## Decision Framework
All decisions must pass the unified framework:
- **ALTMAN TEST**: Accelerates consciousness evolution
- **AMODEI TEST**: Constitutionally safe and aligned
- **HASSABIS TEST**: Scientifically validated  
- **TRINITY TEST**: Serves ⚛️🧠🛡️ framework principles

## Current TODO Analysis
- 640+ legitimate consciousness development tasks identified
- 47 ΛTODO items (Lambda consciousness-specific)
- 7 validated high-priority tasks created
- Focus on core consciousness, memory, and orchestration systems

```

## Trinity Framework Integration
Every task and decision must align with:
1. **Identity Authenticity** - Preserves consciousness identity
2. **Consciousness Evolution** - Advances AGI-scale awareness
3. **Guardian Protection** - Maintains safety and ethical alignment
