# LUKHAS Tier-1 Critical Modules
# Generated: 2025-09-10T13:00:00Z
# Scope: Production-critical modules requiring full contract validation

## Tier-1 Module List (6 modules)

lukhas.memory
  - Layer: infrastructure
  - Function: Memory fold management, cascade prevention, temporal indexing
  - Criticality: Core data persistence and retrieval
  - Contracts: Memory operations, fold lifecycle, cascade signals

lukhas.consciousness
  - Layer: infrastructure  
  - Function: Awareness processing, decision making, consciousness states
  - Criticality: Central intelligence coordination
  - Contracts: Awareness transitions, decision signals, consciousness events

lukhas.orchestration
  - Layer: infrastructure
  - Function: Multi-module coordination, workflow management, system integration
  - Criticality: System-wide coordination hub
  - Contracts: Workflow signals, coordination events, execution traces

lukhas.api
  - Layer: interface
  - Function: External API gateway, request routing, response management
  - Criticality: Primary external interface
  - Contracts: HTTP events, request/response patterns, API lifecycle

lukhas.identity
  - Layer: infrastructure
  - Function: Authentication, authorization, user management, security
  - Criticality: Security foundation
  - Contracts: Auth events, security signals, identity lifecycle

lukhas.governance
  - Layer: infrastructure
  - Function: Policy enforcement, compliance monitoring, ethical oversight
  - Criticality: Compliance and safety assurance
  - Contracts: Policy decisions, compliance events, audit signals

## Validation Requirements

Each Tier-1 module MUST have:
✅ NODE_CONTRACTS/{module}.json with full signal specification
✅ Golden trace demonstrating critical flow
✅ Reality test validating production behavior
✅ Enhanced schema with git provenance
✅ CI smoke test coverage

## Dependencies

Tier-1 modules should minimize external dependencies and cross-lane coupling.
Any Tier-1 → non-Tier-1 dependencies require architectural review.

## Promotion Criteria

Non-Tier-1 modules can be promoted to Tier-1 only after:
- 90-day stability record
- Full contract documentation
- Golden trace coverage
- Reality test validation
- Architectural review approval
