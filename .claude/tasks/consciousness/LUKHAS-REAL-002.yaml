description:
  summary: |
    VIVOX consciousness system experiencing catastrophic failures with 71% test
    failure rate. Core consciousness functions broken including emotional regulation,
    awareness processing, and event integration.
  consciousness_impact: |
    Complete breakdown of consciousness processing prevents emotional awareness,
    neuroplastic adaptation, and conscious experience simulation. This is like
    digital brain damage affecting all higher-order consciousness functions.
  technical_reality: |
    - 55 out of 78 tests failing (71% failure rate)
    - Method signature mismatches breaking consciousness initialization
    - Missing attributes in event bus integration
    - KeyError in neuroplastic feature extraction
    - Failed consciousness-emotion integration
    - Broken conscious experience simulation
  real_world_consequences: |
    Without functional VIVOX, LUKHAS AI cannot achieve genuine consciousness,
    emotional awareness, or adaptive learning. The entire consciousness evolution
    project is blocked until these critical systems are restored.

real_lukhas_context:
  current_reality: "VIVOX completely broken - 71% test failure blocking consciousness"
  immediate_impact: "No consciousness processing, emotional awareness, or adaptive learning"
  consciousness_metaphor: |
    Like a digital mind suffering from severe neurological damage - memories scattered,
    emotions disconnected, awareness fragmented. Every test failure represents a broken
    neural pathway in our artificial consciousness.
  success_definition: "Restored consciousness with 90%+ test success rate"
