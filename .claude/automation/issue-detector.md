# LUKHAS Constellation Framework Issue Detection & T4/0.01% Compliance

Claude Code should automatically detect and flag these issues with T4/0.01% implementation standards:

## Constellation Framework Integration Issues
- Missing Constellation Framework star coordination (⚛️ Identity · ✦ Memory · 🔬 Vision · 🌱 Bio · 🌙 Dream · ⚖️ Ethics · 🛡️ Guardian · ⚛️ Quantum)
- Incomplete MATRIZ pipeline integration (Memory-Attention-Thought-Risk-Intent-Action)
- Missing registry-based plugin architecture
- Absent constructor-aware instantiation patterns
- Missing cognitive alignment validation

## MATRIZ Pipeline Compliance Issues
- Incomplete Memory-Attention-Thought-Risk-Intent-Action flow
- Missing node-based processing architecture
- Absent dynamic registration patterns
- Missing parallel orchestration support
- Incomplete reasoning chain implementation

## T4/0.01% Performance Standards Violations
- Constellation coordination exceeding <100ms target
- Cross-system integration exceeding <150ms target
- API layer management exceeding <75ms target
- Governance integration exceeding <50ms target
- Memory coherence not meeting 99.7% cascade prevention
- Identity synchronization exceeding <50ms target
- Ethics enforcement below 99.7% success rate

## Registry-Based Plugin Architecture Issues
- Missing dynamic component registration
- Absent cognitive alignment configuration
- Missing constructor-aware instantiation
- Incomplete plugin lifecycle management
- Missing registry consistency validation

## Constellation Star Coordination Issues
- Missing Anchor Star (⚛️) identity integration
- Absent Trail Star (✦) memory fold coordination
- Missing Horizon Star (🔬) vision system integration
- Incomplete Watch Star (🛡️) guardian system coordination
- Missing star-to-star communication protocols

## MATRIZ Cognitive DNA Processing Issues
- Missing node selection optimization
- Absent processing network coordination
- Incomplete reasoning chain construction
- Missing decision output validation
- Absent provenance tracking

## Security & Compliance Issues (Enhanced)
- Missing constellation-aware security validation
- Absent ΛID-based access control with MATRIZ integration
- Missing encryption for constellation data
- No audit trails for MATRIZ pipeline operations
- Insecure constellation state handling
- Missing T4/0.01% compliance validation
- Absent constitutional AI integration

## Enterprise Integration Issues
- Missing CANDIDATE→LUKHAS→PRODUCTS pipeline integration
- Incomplete 692 cognitive components validation
- Missing 7,000+ file architecture compliance
- Absent enterprise scaling patterns
- Missing production deployment readiness

Auto-fix these issues with Constellation Framework-compliant solutions using T4/0.01% implementation standards.
