        self.quantum = QuantumProcessor()
        self.bio = BioOscillator(frequency=40)
        
    def process_awareness(self, stimuli):
        quantum_state = self.quantum.superposition(stimuli)
        memory_context = self.memory.recall(quantum_state)
        bio_rhythm = self.bio.oscillate(memory_context)
        return self.synthesize_consciousness(quantum_state, memory_context, bio_rhythm)
```
