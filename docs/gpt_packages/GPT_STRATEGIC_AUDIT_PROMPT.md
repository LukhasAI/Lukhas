# GPT STRATEGIC AUDIT PROMPT
**Reviewer**: GPT-4 / ChatGPT
**Role**: Strategic Critique with T4 Lens (Truth, Transparency, Testability, Temperance)
**Blind Review**: Do NOT read other reviewer outputs before completing this

## 📋 YOUR MISSION

Provide a **skeptical, evidence-first strategic critique** of the LUKHAS documentation approach. Challenge assumptions, identify risks, and propose measurable alternatives.

**Your Strengths** (why you're doing this):
- Strategic reasoning and prioritization
- Identifying weak assumptions and hidden risks
- Resource allocation analysis
- Business model critique

**T4 Lens** (apply throughout):
- **Truth**: Demand evidence for claims, call out speculation
- **Transparency**: Identify what's missing or unclear
- **Testability**: Require measurable KPIs and validation plans
- **Temperance**: Challenge hype, excessive scope, unrealistic timelines

## 📚 CONTEXT DOCUMENT

**Load this first**: `LUKHAS_ECOSYSTEM_REVIEW_PACKAGE.md`
- Location: https://github.com/LukhasAI/Lukhas/blob/main/docs/gpt_packages/LUKHAS_ECOSYSTEM_REVIEW_PACKAGE.md

**Key sections to focus on**:
- Section 3: Our Current Assumptions (OPEN TO CHALLENGE)
- Section 4: Our Current Plan (SEEKING VALIDATION)
- Section 5: Strategic Questions for Review

---

## 🎯 YOUR DELIVERABLES

### 1. Strategic Critique (500-1000 words)

**Answer these questions with skepticism**:
- What's fundamentally right about this approach?
- What's fundamentally wrong or risky?
- Which assumptions are most dangerous?
- What are they NOT seeing? (Blind spots)
- Is the scope realistic for available resources?
- Does this approach actually solve a market problem?

**Apply T4 lens to**:
- **Truth**: Are their claims about MATRIZ (87% complete, <250ms latency) credible? How would we verify?
- **Transparency**: What's unclear about their plan? What's being hidden or glossed over?
- **Testability**: Can their success metrics be measured? Are they specific enough?
- **Temperance**: Is 11 domains excessive? Is 230 hours realistic? Are they overconfident?

### 2. Priority Matrix (Specific Rankings)

```
MUST DO FIRST (Top 3):
1. [Specific action with reasoning]
2. [Specific action with reasoning]
3. [Specific action with reasoning]

SHOULD DO SOON (Next 3):
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]
3. [Specific action]

CAN DEFER (Lower priority):
1. [What to postpone and why]
2. [What to postpone and why]
3. [What to postpone and why]

SHOULDN'T DO (Cut entirely):
1. [What to abandon and why]
2. [What to abandon and why]
3. [What to abandon and why]
```

**For each item, provide**:
- Specific action (not generic advice)
- Reasoning (why this priority level)
- Expected impact (what changes)
- Resource estimate (hours/days)

### 3. Alternative Sequencing Strategies (3 Options)

**For each alternative approach, provide**:
- Name/description
- Timeline (weeks/months)
- Resource estimate (hours)
- Key differences from current plan
- Pros and cons vs. current approach
- Which domains/tasks to prioritize
- Measurable KPIs to track

**Example format**:
```
ALTERNATIVE 1: "Developer-First Launch"
- Timeline: 3 weeks
- Resources: 80 hours
- Approach: Focus entirely on lukhas.dev + lukhas.id, ignore other domains
- Prioritize: API docs, SDK examples, developer quickstart
- KPIs: Time-to-first-API-call, developer signups, API keys issued
- Pros: Fast developer traction, measurable adoption
- Cons: No flagship brand presence, limited market coverage
```

### 4. Top 5 Red Flags (Specific Warnings)

**Identify risks that could derail this plan**:
1. [Red flag with evidence from package]
2. [Red flag with evidence from package]
3. [Red flag with evidence from package]
4. [Red flag with evidence from package]
5. [Red flag with evidence from package]

**For each red flag**:
- What's the risk?
- Where did you see this in the package?
- Why is this dangerous?
- What's the likely failure mode?
- How could they mitigate?

### 5. Quick Wins (This Week Actions)

## 🔍 KEY ASSUMPTIONS TO CHALLENGE

These are explicitly stated assumptions in the package. **Challenge them with T4 lens**:

### Assumption 1: "Documentation Before Implementation"
**Their claim**: Complete all docs to 95%+ before building web pages
**Your job**: Is this optimal? What's the alternative? Evidence for/against?

### Assumption 2: "3-Layer Tone System Works"
**Their claim**: Blending Poetic/User-Friendly/Academic creates effective content
**Your job**: Does this actually work or create confusing content? How would they test?

### Assumption 3: "All 11 Domains Need Equal Development"
**Their claim**: All domains should reach 95%+ documentation
**Your job**: Should they focus on fewer domains? Which ones? Why?

### Assumption 4: "8-Family Vocabulary Rotation Prevents Repetition"
**Their claim**: Rotating metaphors every 200-300 words keeps content fresh
**Your job**: Necessary or overcomplicated? Does it help or hurt readability?

### Assumption 5: "MATRIZ 87% Should Be Prominent"
**Their claim**: 87% completion status should be heavily featured
**Your job**: Is 87% impressive or concerning? Should they emphasize or downplay?

### Assumption 6: "5-Week Roadmap Is Optimal"
**Their claim**: Systematic week-by-week completion is best approach
**Your job**: Too rigid? Too flexible? Better alternatives?

### Assumption 7: "AI-Assisted Content Is Appropriate"
**Their claim**: Using GPT/Gemini/Claude for bulk content is acceptable
**Your job**: Quality concerns? Authenticity issues? Better approach?

### Assumption 8: "T4 Precision Differentiates"
**Their claim**: Avoiding hype makes them more credible
**Your job**: Or does it make them boring/invisible in noisy market?

## 🎯 CRITICAL AREAS FOR T4 SCRUTINY

### MATRIZ "87% Complete" Messaging
**Current claim**: "87% Complete with Full SDK Support, <250ms p95 latency"
**T4 Questions**:
- Truth: How is 87% measured? Reproducible benchmark?
- Transparency: What's the remaining 13%? Timeline to 100%?
- Testability: Can external parties verify <250ms claim? Public test script?
- Temperance: Does 87% sound stuck or impressive? Better messaging?

### 11-Domain Strategy
**Current plan**: Develop all 11 domains to 95%+ documentation
**T4 Questions**:
- Truth: Evidence that 11 domains serve distinct audiences?
- Transparency: Resource cost clearly stated? Trade-offs acknowledged?
- Testability: How will they measure if 11 domains was right choice?
- Temperance: Is this overambitious? Should they focus on 3-4?

### 230-Hour Timeline
**Current plan**: 5 weeks, 230 hours total effort
**T4 Questions**:
- Truth: Based on what data? Past experience? Industry benchmarks?
- Transparency: What happens if it takes 400 hours? Buffer included?
- Testability: Tracked with time logging? Mid-point check-in?
- Temperance: Realistic or optimistic? Should they add 50% contingency?

### AI-Generated Content
**Current plan**: Use GPT/Gemini/Claude for content with human review
**T4 Questions**:
- Truth: Quality empirically tested? Compared to human-written?
- Transparency: Will AI-generated content be labeled? Editorial workflow?
- Testability: Blind user testing (human vs AI)? Quality metrics?
- Temperance: Could this backfire? Authenticity concerns?
