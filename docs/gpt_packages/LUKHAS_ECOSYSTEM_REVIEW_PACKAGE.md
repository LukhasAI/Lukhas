## 🎯 SECTION 3: OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS (OPEN TO CHALLENGE)

These are assumptions we've made. **Please critique these assumptions.**

### Assumption 1: Documentation Before Implementation
**Our assumption**: Complete all documentation to 95%+ before building web pages
**Reasoning**: Ensures consistency, prevents rework, establishes clear vision
**Question for review**: Is this the right sequence? Should we build and document in parallel?

### Assumption 2: 3-Layer Tone System Works
**Our assumption**: Blending Poetic/User-Friendly/Academic in specific percentages creates effective content
**Reasoning**: Appeals to multiple audience types simultaneously
**Question for review**: Is this too complex? Does it actually work or create confusing content?

### Assumption 3: All 11 Domains Need Equal Development
**Our assumption**: All domains should reach 95%+ documentation completion
**Reasoning**: Complete ecosystem coverage, no weak spots
**Question for review**: Should we focus on fewer domains first? Is 11 domains too many?

### Assumption 4: 8-Family Vocabulary Rotation Prevents Repetition
**Our assumption**: Rotating metaphorical families every 200-300 words keeps content fresh
**Reasoning**: Avoids overused phrases while maintaining brand consistency
**Question for review**: Is this necessary or overly prescriptive? Does it help or hurt readability?

### Assumption 5: MATRIZ Completion (87%) Should Be Prominent
**Our assumption**: MATRIZ's 87% completion status should be heavily featured in technical domains
**Reasoning**: Shows real progress, establishes credibility
**Question for review**: Is 87% complete actually impressive or does it suggest incompleteness? Should we emphasize or downplay?

### Assumption 6: Week-by-Week Roadmap Is Optimal
**Our assumption**: 5-week systematic roadmap (Week 1: Homepages, Week 2: APIs, etc.) is the right approach
**Reasoning**: Systematic completion, clear milestones, parallel work streams
**Question for review**: Is this too rigid? Should we be more flexible or opportunistic?

### Assumption 7: AI-Assisted Content Creation Is Appropriate
**Our assumption**: Using GPT/Gemini/Claude to generate bulk of content with human review is acceptable
**Reasoning**: Speed, consistency, scalability
**Question for review**: Does AI-generated content lack authenticity? Should humans write more from scratch?

### Assumption 8: T4 Precision (No Hype) Is Differentiating
**Our assumption**: Avoiding marketing superlatives makes us more credible
**Reasoning**: Academic restraint builds trust
**Question for review**: Does this make us boring? Are we handicapping ourselves in a hype-driven market?

---

## 📋 SECTION 4: OUR CURRENT PLAN (SEEKING VALIDATION)

This is our proposed 5-week roadmap. **Please critique the sequencing, priorities, and approach.**

### Week 1: Homepage Content (8 documents)
**Plan**: Create 5 new homepages + update 3 existing for MATRIZ
**Effort**: ~40 hours
**Domains**: lukhas.io, store, team, us, xyz (new) + ai, dev, com (update)
**Rationale**: Homepages are entry points; must exist before anything else

**Question for review**: Is this the right starting point? Should something else come first?

### Week 2: Developer Platform (lukhas.dev)
**Plan**: Complete all developer documentation
**Effort**: ~60 hours
**Deliverables**:
- 4 API documentation pages (Consciousness, Identity, Trinity, Teams)
- 6 SDK documentation pages (Python, JS, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin)
- Quickstart guides (5-minute + comprehensive)
- Integration patterns (5-10 patterns)

**Rationale**: Developer adoption is critical; technical docs unlock platform use

**Question for review**: Is this too much for one week? Should we spread it out? Right priority?

### Week 3: Pillar Pages (11 documents)
**Plan**: Deep content for SEO and expertise demonstration
**Effort**: ~50 hours
**Breakdown**:
- lukhas.ai: 5 pillar pages (Vision, Dream, Bio, Ethics, Guardian stars)
- lukhas.dev: 3 pillar pages (Reasoning Lab, Production Patterns, Community)
- lukhas.com: 3 pillar pages (Guardian System, Enterprise Security, Case Studies)

**Rationale**: SEO requires deep content; pillar pages establish authority

**Question for review**: Are pillar pages necessary? Should we focus on other content types?

### Week 4: Marketplace & Collaboration
**Plan**: Complete lukhas.store and lukhas.team documentation
**Effort**: ~40 hours
**Deliverables**:
- Marketplace: App submission guidelines, categories, revenue share, review process
- Team: Collaboration features, workflows, pricing, use cases

**Rationale**: Commercial domains need complete docs before launch

**Question for review**: Should these domains be lower priority? Defer until later?

### Week 5: Compliance Documentation
**Plan**: Complete regulatory and legal documentation
**Effort**: ~40 hours (+ legal review buffer)
**Deliverables**:
- lukhas.eu: Additional GDPR/EU AI Act documentation
- lukhas.us: AI Bill of Rights, NIST framework alignment
- Regulatory transparency pages

**Rationale**: Compliance is non-negotiable for regulated markets

**Question for review**: Should compliance documentation be earlier? Is legal review realistic in one week?

### Timeline Summary
- **Total Effort**: 230 hours
- **Duration**: 5 weeks with parallel work streams
- **Target Completion**: 95%+ documentation across all domains
- **Approach**: AI-assisted content creation with human review

## 🔍 SECTION 5: STRATEGIC QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

We need your independent perspective on these strategic questions:

### Priority & Sequencing
1. **What should we focus on FIRST?** (Homepage? Developers? Compliance? Something else?)
2. **Which domains are most critical?** (Should we concentrate on 3-4 domains instead of all 11?)
3. **What's the minimum viable documentation?** (What can we defer or skip entirely?)
4. **Should we document before building or build first?** (Is our sequence backwards?)

### Content Strategy
5. **Is the 3-layer tone system actually effective?** (Or confusing/overcomplicated?)
6. **Does 8-family vocabulary rotation help or hurt?** (Does it create artificial-sounding content?)
7. **Is "no hype" actually a competitive advantage?** (Or does it make us invisible in a noisy market?)
8. **Should different domains have completely different voices?** (More variation than our current approach?)

### Resource Allocation
9. **Is 230 hours realistic for this scope?** (Under/over-estimated?)
10. **Can AI-generated content be high quality enough?** (Or should we budget more human writing time?)
11. **Should we hire specialized writers?** (Technical writers, content strategists, copywriters?)
12. **What can we cut without hurting the vision?** (What's truly essential vs. nice-to-have?)

### Architecture & Approach
13. **Are 11 domains too many?** (Should we consolidate? Which ones could merge?)
14. **Is the Constellation Framework (8 stars) clear to outsiders?** (Or is it confusing internal jargon?)
15. **Should we feature MATRIZ (87% complete) prominently?** (Or is that highlighting incompleteness?)
16. **Are our domain purposes well-differentiated?** (Or do some overlap/compete?)

### Market & Positioning
17. **Who is our PRIMARY audience?** (Developers? Enterprises? Researchers? General public?)
18. **What makes LUKHAS different from competitors?** (Is it clear in our documentation?)
19. **Should we lead with consciousness/philosophy or practical tools?** (Which hooks people better?)
20. **Are we trying to serve too many audiences?** (Should we narrow focus?)

### Risk & Validation
21. **What are we missing that could derail this plan?** (Blind spots? Hidden assumptions?)
22. **How should we validate our content is effective?** (What metrics? User testing?)
23. **What happens if MATRIZ completion stalls at 87%?** (How does that affect messaging?)
24. **Should we have different plans for different scenarios?** (Best case, worst case, most likely?)
