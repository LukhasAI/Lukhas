# T4 TODO Analysis Summary

This directory contains comprehensive analysis reports of TODO items marked with T4 patterns throughout the LUKHAS codebase.

## TODO Types

- **T4-AUTOFIX**: Items that can be safely automated through T4 system transformations
- **T4-MANUAL**: Items requiring human review and manual intervention
- **T4-RESEARCH**: Items needing investigation before implementation decisions
- **T4-SECURITY**: Security-sensitive changes requiring extra careful review

## Reports Generated

- `current-todos.md`: Live analysis of current TODO markers in codebase
- `historical-trends.md`: Tracking TODO creation and resolution over time
- `priority-analysis.md`: Prioritized breakdown by impact and urgency

## Usage with T4 System

1. **Automated Analysis**: Run `tools/ci/mark_todos.py --report-only --output reports/todos/current-todos.md`
2. **Interactive Fixes**: Use `⌘⇧,` in VS Code to trigger T4 QuickFix on T4-AUTOFIX items
3. **Nightly Processing**: Automated analysis and annotation runs via GitHub Actions
4. **Manual Review**: Review T4-MANUAL and T4-SECURITY items in team sessions

## Integration Points

- VS Code Tasks: T4 TODO reports available via Command Palette
- GitHub Actions: Automated nightly analysis and PR comment generation
- CI/CD Pipeline: Block merges when critical TODOs remain unaddressed
- Code Review: Annotated suggestions help reviewers understand context

## Metrics Tracked

- Total TODO count and breakdown by type
- Average age of TODO items
- Resolution velocity by category
- Hot spots (files/modules with high TODO density)
- Sprint burn-down of T4-AUTOFIX items
