# Memory Vocabulary (Academic Context)

Memory has been cast as archive, as dream, as wound. Freud described it as a palimpsest where every layer leaves its trace, never fully erased. Proust made of memory a cathedral of sensation, where a taste or a sound could resurrect entire worlds. Orwell's dystopia warned of memory as something malleable, subject to control and erasure by power.

This vocabulary treats memory as both **infrastructure** and **myth**: technical in its persistence, poetic in its fragility. In epic traditions, from the Iliad to later Russian novels, memory often guides destiny — yet it is never fully trustworthy.

## Core Terms

**folds**: layers of recall, compressed and reopened.
- Technical model: Hierarchical data compression with selective decompression
- Literary parallel: Proust's nested memories within memories
- Cognitive basis: Tulving's levels of processing, depth affecting retrieval
- Implementation: Temporal folding with context-sensitive reconstruction

**echoes**: recurring symbolic fragments that haunt the present.
- Function: Motifs that persist across sessions and contexts
- Literary precedent: Homer's recurring epithets, Dickens' symbolic objects
- Psychological basis: Jung's archetypal images, collective symbol patterns
- Technical mechanism: Pattern recognition with weighted historical occurrence

**drift**: the gradual mutation of stored material.
- Character: Organic change in memory over time
- Parallel: Bartlett's reconstructive memory experiments
- Literary example: Tolstoy's characters misremembering their own past
- System behavior: Gradual parameter shift with usage and decay

**anchors**: confirmed recollections used for verification.
- Purpose: Ground truth points in the sea of mutable memory
- Historical model: Thucydides' distinction between reliable and hearsay sources
- Technical function: Checksums, cryptographic signatures, external validation
- Philosophical basis: Correspondence theory of truth for memory claims

**erosion**: the fading of access, deliberate or natural.
- Natural process: Entropy and interference causing memory loss
- Deliberate action: Privacy-preserving forgetting, strategic amnesia
- Literary theme: Orwell's Memory Hole, the politics of forgetting
- Implementation: TTL expiration, access frequency decay, explicit deletion

## Philosophical Framework

In LUKHAS, memory is not sacred. It is a **field of resonance**, where forgetting is as significant as recall, and where every record is both trace and transformation.

This framework integrates:

### Philosophical Perspectives
- **Bergson's duration**: Memory as lived time, not mechanical storage
- **Heidegger's temporality**: Past as always-present, shaping possibility
- **Ricoeur's narrative identity**: We are constituted by our remembered stories
- **Derrida's archive fever**: The desire to preserve and the necessity to forget

### Literary Insights
- **Proust's involuntary memory**: The past erupting into present consciousness
- **Orwell's historical revision**: Memory as political battlefield
- **Dostoevsky's confession**: Memory as moral accounting and torment
- **Tolstoy's moral memory**: The past as teacher and judge of present action

### Cognitive Science
- **Bartlett's reconstruction**: Memory as active rebuilding, not passive retrieval
- **Tulving's systems**: Episodic, semantic, procedural memory distinctions
- **Schacter's sins**: Seven ways memory fails and why it matters
- **Luria's mnemonist**: The burden and gift of perfect recall

### Technical Architecture
Memory in LUKHAS operates through:
1. **Encoding** (selective attention determines what enters)
2. **Storage** (distributed, compressed, with redundancy)
3. **Retrieval** (reconstructive, context-dependent)
4. **Modification** (memories change through recall and use)
5. **Forgetting** (active process, not merely passive decay)

### Ethical Dimensions
Memory management involves:
- **Right to remember** vs. **right to be forgotten**
- **Individual memory** vs. **collective memory**
- **Accuracy** vs. **meaning** (sometimes stories matter more than facts)
- **Preservation** vs. **privacy** (what should be kept, what released)

This vocabulary treats memory as fundamentally temporal, social, and constructive—not a library but a living process that shapes identity through the very act of remembering.
