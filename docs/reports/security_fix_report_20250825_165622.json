        "risk_assessment": "The vulnerability in FastAPI, identified by CVE-2024-24762, has a high severity level because it might lead to unauthorized access and data manipulation if exploited. It is believed that this issue could potentially allow for remote code execution.",
        "fix_strategy": "It's recommended to update the package as soon as possible by running the command: pip install fastapi --upgrade",
        "potential_issues": "There are a few potential issues that might arise during the upgrade. For instance, it could lead to inconsistencies between server and client dependencies if not handled properly. Additionally, certain application functionalities may stop working due to changes in APIs or database schema.",
