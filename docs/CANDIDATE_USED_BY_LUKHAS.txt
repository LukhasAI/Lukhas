./reports/audit/neutral_20250910T143306Z.md:16:**Import Health**: Many critical syntax issues (e.g. missing f-string braces, indent errors) were fixed, but some fatal errors remain. For example, undefined names like a logger in archived memory code still exist. Cross-lane imports (production lukhas modules improperly importing experimental candidate code) have been largely isolated. A lane guard report flags instances such as lukhas.core.swarm importing from candidate, now moved to quarantine. 
./reports/audit/neutral_20250910T143306Z.md:83:	•	Cross-Lane Imports Quarantined: Lukhas ↔ Candidate layer breaches - The lint report flags direct imports from candidate within lukhas modules, now disallowed. For example, lukhas.core.swarm and others were importing candidate code . A recent “lanes” audit isolated these (e.g. moved to quarantine/).
./docs/makefile/README.md:169:This prevents stable components (`lukhas/`) from importing experimental components (`candidate/`), maintaining system integrity and preventing dependency inversions.
