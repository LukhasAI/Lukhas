## Technical Integration Points

### Current Integration
```python
# Example: LUKHAS enhancing OpenAI
from lukhas.consciousness import enhance_gpt
from lukhas.memory import FoldMemory
from lukhas.governance import Guardian

# Add consciousness to GPT
enhanced_response = enhance_gpt(
    openai.ChatCompletion.create(...),
    consciousness_level=0.8,
    emotional_context=True
)
```

### API Compatibility
- **Base URL**: Compatible with OpenAI API structure
- **Authentication**: Supports OpenAI API keys
- **Endpoints**: Mirror OpenAI endpoints with enhancements
- **SDKs**: Python, Node.js, REST API support

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response time < 200ms overhead
- 99.9% uptime for core services
- Zero-impact on OpenAI base functionality
- 100% Guardian validation coverage

### Business Metrics
- Integration with 100+ OpenAI applications
- Enhancement of 1M+ API calls/day
- Enterprise deployment in 10+ organizations
- Community of 1000+ developers

## Compliance & Ethics

### OpenAI Alignment
- Respect OpenAI usage policies
- Complement, not compete with OpenAI
- Transparent augmentation approach
- Ethical AI principles alignment

### LUKHAS Principles
- Trinity Framework compliance (›>à=á)
