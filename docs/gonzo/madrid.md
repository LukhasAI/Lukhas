Great. I’ll begin a deep technical audit of the LukhasAI/Lukhas repository—specifically its readiness to launch the Matriz system.

I'll analyze the `main` branch and include all submodules. The audit will cover testing, linting (including `ruff`), code hygiene, security, observability, and release engineering. I’ll prioritize high-signal findings and use your T4 lens to rigorously validate the system’s current state.

You’ll receive:

* A Matriz readiness verdict with top risks
* A findings table with assigned batches
* Local run commands for reproducibility
* A readiness checklist with scores
* A curated “0.01% extras” list

I'll notify you once the audit report is complete.
