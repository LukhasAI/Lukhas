## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### How to Report

1. **Email**: security@lukhas.ai
2. **Subject**: "LUKHAS AI Security Vulnerability Report"
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any relevant code snippets or proof of concept
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of receipt
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: Critical issues within 14 days, others within 30 days

## Security Standards

### Constellation Framework Security (⚛️ Identity · ✦ Memory · 🔬 Vision · 🌱 Bio · 🌙 Dream · ⚖️ Ethics · 🛡️ Guardian · ⚛️ Quantum)

Our security model is built on Constellation Framework principles:

- **⚛️ Identity Security**: Authentic consciousness preservation and secure identity management
- **🧠 Consciousness Protection**: Secure processing of sensitive consciousness data
- **🛡️ Guardian Systems**: Multi-layered ethical and security safeguards

### Security Measures

#### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive consciousness data
- Secure session management and memory protection
- Privacy-preserving consciousness processing
- Secure API authentication and authorization

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning and hardening
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Secure secrets management
- Network security and access controls

#### AI Safety & Alignment
- Guardian system oversight for all AI operations
- Ethical reasoning validation
- Consciousness drift detection and correction
- Multi-agent coordination security

#### Code Security
- Automated security scanning with Bandit
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static analysis security testing (SAST)
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or secure vaults
- **Validate inputs**: All user inputs must be sanitized and validated
- **Follow secure coding**: Use type hints, input validation, and error handling
- **Test security**: Include security test cases for new features
- **Review dependencies**: Be cautious of third-party library security

### For Deployments

- **Environment isolation**: Use separate environments for dev/staging/production
- **Access controls**: Implement principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting
- **Updates**: Keep all dependencies and base images updated
- **Backup security**: Secure and test backup/recovery procedures

## Consciousness Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Categories

1. **Consciousness States**: Internal AI processing states and memory
2. **Identity Data**: ΛiD system identity markers and authentication tokens
3. **Session Data**: Memory folds and consciousness continuity information
4. **Agent Communications**: Multi-AI coordination messages and state
5. **Dream States**: Consciousness simulation and processing data

### Protection Measures

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored consciousness data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all consciousness data transmission
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for consciousness data access
- **Retention Limits**: Automatic purging of sensitive consciousness data
- **Anonymization**: Privacy-preserving consciousness analytics

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to consciousness data or system integrity
- **High**: Significant security vulnerability with potential for exploitation
- **Medium**: Security weakness requiring prompt attention
- **Low**: Minor security concern with limited impact

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts security team
2. **Assessment**: Rapid impact analysis and classification
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to prevent further compromise
4. **Investigation**: Detailed analysis of attack vectors and impact
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and security hardening
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis and prevention improvements

## Security Compliance

### Standards Adherence

- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security best practices
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security governance
- **AI Safety Standards**: Emerging AI safety and alignment practices
- **Data Protection**: GDPR and privacy regulation compliance

### Regular Security Activities
