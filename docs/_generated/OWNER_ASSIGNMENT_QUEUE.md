# Documentation Owner Assignment Queue

**Total docs needing owners**: 1067

## Policy

All documentation must have a designated owner for accountability and maintenance.
- `owner: unknown` is a governance flag requiring assignment
- Owners can be individuals (@username) or teams (@team-name)
- Quarterly curation sprints review orphaned ownership

## Assignment Process

1. Review doc content and context
2. Check suggested owner (from git blame or module)
3. Update front-matter: `owner: @username` or `owner: team-name`
4. Commit: `docs(owner): assign ownership for <module>/<file>`
