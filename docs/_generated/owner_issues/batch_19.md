# Documentation Owner Assignment - Batch 19

**Docs in batch**: 20
**SLA**: 2025-11-06 (30 days)

## Assignment Instructions

1. Review each doc's content and context
2. Verify suggested owner (from git blame or module mapping)
3. Update front-matter: `owner: @username` or `owner: team-name`
4. Commit: `docs(owner): assign ownership for <module>/<file>`
5. Check the box when complete
