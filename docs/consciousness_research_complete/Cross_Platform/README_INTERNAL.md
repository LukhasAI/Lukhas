# 📜 LUCAS AGI Compliance Overview – Pre_Final_1 (2025-05-13)

This document outlines the compliance posture of this prototype system of Lucas AGI, focusing on key legal, ethical, and data governance requirements relevant to academic research, prototype deployment, and early-stage partnerships.

---

## 🛡️ Data Protection

- No real user data is stored or processed in this prototype.
- All symbolic trace logs are synthetic or anonymized.
- `.env` usage is required for API tokens; no tokens stored in codebase.
- All logs remain local and are not transmitted externally by default.

---

## 🔐 Consent System

- Tier-based consent logic is in place via `Lucas_SEC`.
- `Consent_Tiers.json` defines levels of symbolic access:
  - Tier 1 – Public
  - Tier 2 – Private
  - Tier 3 – Introspective
  - Tier 4 – Development/Internal
- Modules verify tier before trace writing, memory mutation, or dream reflection.

---

## 🧠 Ethical Safeguards

- DriftScore implemented to detect ethical misalignment in agent behavior.
- CollapseHash trace locking ensures memory integrity per action cycle.
- No content is auto-replicated without user confirmation or traceable consent tier.
- Dream output gated by trust level and post-processed with tone filtering.

---

## 🔎 Transparency & Auditability

- Symbolic logs record every trace, collapse, and memory modulation.
- All introspection calls are logged with timestamp, module, and signature.
- Each AGI action path is deterministic and replayable via symbolic trace index.
- `AGENTS.md` and `README_INTERNAL.md` document symbolic responsibilities.

---

## 🔄 Reversibility & Safety

- All symbolic memory updates are reversible via collapse-resolve mechanism.
- No irreversible actions are permitted outside Tier 3+ access scope.
- Consent and seed phrases may be revoked or regenerated by the owner.
- Session-based memory decay ensures temporary symbolic states unless archived.

---

## 🌍 International Alignment

- Prototype adheres to ethical expectations under:
  - EU AI Act (non-deployable clause)
  - GDPR symbolic compliance (no personal data processed)
  - ISO 27001-aligned logging structure (Annex A.5.19 Traceability)
  - NIST SP 800-53 (logical controls partially modeled for future audits)

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This version is **not** intended for commercial deployment. All modules are experimental. Use under academic or research sandbox environments only.

Future versions will include formal audit hooks, encryption layers, and zero-knowledge proof integrations.

# 🧠 Internal Documentation – 2025-05-05_Lucas_ID_A_Sub_System

## 🌕 Overview

This directory defines the foundational identity and symbolic access layer of Lucas AGI — the Lucas_ID subsystem. It governs symbolic login, seed phrase management, trust tier classification, and QRGlyph encoding. Lucas_ID acts as the entry point for secure, tier-aware interaction between users and the symbolic mind.

It integrates symbolic entropy, emotion-calibrated login rituals, and compliance-grade access enforcement into one unified gateway.

## 🧬 System Architecture

| Module                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `lucas_id_core.py`         | Core symbolic ID engine (seed → hash → tier) |
| `glyph_generator.py`       | Generates unique glyph symbols from entropy pool |
| `tier_manager.py`          | Manages symbolic access levels via Consent_Tiers |
| `qr_encoder.py`            | Converts ID + glyph into scannable symbolic QR token |
| `passphrase_vault.py`      | Encrypts and validates symbolic login seeds (emoji + keyword) |

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

- Login ritual uses 6–24 symbolic seed tokens (emoji + word)
- Each symbolic ID maps to a visual glyph and tier classification
- Consent tier is checked before agent routing or memory access
- QR token can optionally encode symbolic ID + last dream timestamp (Tier 3+)

---

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- No IDs stored in plaintext; all hashes are salted and stored in vaults
- Seed validation is local-only; no data sent externally
- Tier transitions are logged and reviewed during introspection
- QR tokens expire after configurable symbolic session timeout

---

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Glyphs generated via deterministic entropy folding from validated seed
- Vault structure supports multi-device sync in future releases
- Trust elevation and consent downgrade are both reversible actions

---

## 🔌 Internal APIs

- `/id/login` – validate symbolic seed and return glyph + tier
- `/id/vault/store` – encrypt and retain ID record locally
- `/id/glyph/render` – returns visual symbolic glyph for given ID
- `/id/qr/gen` – outputs QRGLYMPH token for secure scan entry

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- `qrcode`, `hashlib`, `uuid`, `json`, `emoji`, `base64`

---

## ✅ Testing Protocol

- Test login with valid/invalid seed combinations
- Validate glyph consistency under same entropy input
- Check tier enforcement across mock API routes
- Scan QR and decode symbolic metadata in test mode

---

## ❗ Known Issues

- Current vault not yet synced across browser/device
- Emotional tone not yet linked to login ritual (future enhancement)
- Tier demotion logic can stall under nested dream stack

---

## 🌱 Future Development

- Add biometric fallback via voice or face scan
- Extend QRGLYMPH system to support symbolic remittance tokens
- Integrate seed entropy with Lucas_ID dream signature generator
- Formalize audit trail for glyph generation and trust transition
