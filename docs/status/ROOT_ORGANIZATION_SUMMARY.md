# Root Directory Organization Summary

## ✅ Organization Complete!

### What We Organized:

1. **VIVOX Files**:
   - Test files moved to `tests/vivox/`
   - Reports moved to `docs/reports/vivox/`
   - Examples moved to `examples/vivox/`

2. **Documentation**:
   - Analysis reports moved to `docs/analysis/`
   - Planning documents moved to `docs/planning/`
   - Z_C guides moved to `docs/`

3. **Test Files**:
   - General tests moved to `tests/`
   - VIVOX-specific tests to `tests/vivox/`

4. **New Structure Created**:
   ```
   lukhas/common/        # Common utilities and infrastructure
   api/                  # New API implementations
   feedback/             # Enterprise feedback system
   dashboard/            # Interpretability dashboard
   consciousness_api/    # API stub for future expansion
   memory_api/          # API stub for future expansion
   ```

### Root Directory Now Contains Only:
- Essential config files (.env.example, .gitignore, etc.)
- Core documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE)
- Main entry point (main.py)
- Package files (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
- Project workspace file

### Benefits:
