# LUKHAS AI: A Practical Guide to Safe and Responsible Usage

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active

This guide provides practical advice for using the LUKHAS AI platform safely and responsibly. Following these guidelines helps ensure ethical outcomes and minimizes potential risks.

## Checklist for Responsible Use

-   [ ] **Verify Critical Information**: Do not trust AI-generated outputs for life-critical decisions (medical, financial, legal) without verification by a qualified human professional.
-   [ ] **Respect Privacy**: Avoid inputting sensitive personal data (yours or others') unless strictly necessary for the task.
-   [ ] **Assume Good Faith, but Check for Bias**: Be aware that AI can reflect societal biases. Critically review content for fairness and inclusivity.
-   [ ] **Keep Humans in the Loop**: Use the AI to augment, not replace, human judgment, especially in complex or high-stakes situations.
-   [ ] **Provide Clear Instructions**: The quality of the output often depends on the quality of the input. Be specific and provide sufficient context in your prompts.
-   [ ] **Report Concerns**: If you encounter any output that seems unsafe, unethical, or biased, use the reporting channels to flag it immediately.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

-   **Over-reliance**: Treating the AI as an infallible oracle. It is a tool with limitations and can make mistakes.
-   **Confirmation Bias**: Only accepting AI outputs that confirm your existing beliefs, and dismissing those that don't.
-   **Misunderstanding Scope**: Expecting the AI to have genuine understanding, emotions, or consciousness. It is a sophisticated pattern-matching system.
-   **Inputting Proprietary Information**: Do not paste confidential or proprietary information from your organization into the AI.
-   **Chain-Prompting without Verification**: Building a complex result by feeding one AI output directly into the next prompt without validating each step can amplify errors.

## When to Seek Human Review

It is crucial to involve a qualified human expert in the following situations:

-   **High-Stakes Decisions**: Any decision that could have a significant impact on an individual's rights, opportunities, or well-being (e.g., hiring, loan applications, medical screening).
-   **Ambiguous or Nuanced Context**: When the subject matter is highly nuanced, subjective, or open to interpretation (e.g., policy analysis, psychological assessment).
-   **Safety-Critical Applications**: Any use case where a failure could lead to physical harm (e.g., engineering specifications, safety protocols).
-   **Unexpected or Anomalous Output**: If the AI produces a response that is bizarre, nonsensical, or seems to indicate a system fault.
-   **Before Public Dissemination**: Before publishing AI-generated content, especially on sensitive topics, have it reviewed for accuracy and tone.

## Example Scenarios

### Good Usage Example: Content Summarization

-   **Scenario**: A researcher needs to quickly understand the key findings of a dozen academic papers.
-   **Responsible Use**:
    1.  The researcher uploads the papers and prompts the AI: "For each of these papers, please summarize the key findings, methodology, and limitations in a structured format."
    2.  The AI provides the summaries.
    3.  The researcher reads the AI-generated summaries to get a high-level overview.
    4.  For the most relevant papers identified through the summaries, the researcher reads the original papers to ensure a deep and accurate understanding before citing them in their own work.
-   **Why it's good**: The AI is used as a tool to accelerate the research process, but the final critical analysis and verification are performed by the human expert.

### Bad Usage Example: Automated Medical Diagnosis

-   **Scenario**: A developer wants to create an app that provides medical diagnoses.
-   **Irresponsible Use**:
    1.  The developer prompts the AI: "A user has a headache and a fever. What is the diagnosis?"
    2.  The AI responds with "It could be the flu or meningitis."
    3.  The developer builds an app that takes these symptoms and directly displays "You might have meningitis" to the user.
-   **Why it's bad**: This is a prohibited and dangerous use case. It bypasses a qualified medical professional for a life-critical decision, could cause undue panic, and might lead to a user ignoring a real medical emergency or self-treating incorrectly based on flawed information.
