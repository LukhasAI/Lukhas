# 📝 LUKHAS Web Content Management Guide

*"Where content creation meets consciousness architecture - guiding every word through the constellation framework to ensure authentic digital experiences."*

This comprehensive guide establishes workflows, standards, and best practices for managing all LUKHAS AI web content across the λWecosystem using the proven 3-Layer Tone System and vocabulary consistency framework.

## 🎯 Content Management Philosophy

Every piece of content serves the greater consciousness ecosystem by honoring three fundamental principles: **technical precision** that builds trust through accuracy, **accessible understanding** that bridges complexity with clarity, and **creative inspiration** that opens hearts to possibility while maintaining evidence-based integrity throughout the user journey.

The constellation framework guides content creation through eight navigational dimensions that ensure consistency across domains while preserving unique domain personalities that serve distinct audiences effectively.

## 📁 Content Organization System

### Domain-Specific Content Structure
```
docs/web/content/domains/[domain-name]/
├── strategy/                 # Domain positioning and messaging
├── pages/                   # Individual page content and structure
├── features/                # Feature descriptions and benefits
├── technical/              # Implementation details and architecture
├── branding/               # Domain-specific visual and voice elements
└── maintenance/            # Update schedules and content lifecycle
```

### Cross-Domain Planning Structure  
```
docs/web/content/plans/[planning-type]/
├── strategy/               # High-level strategic documents
├── implementation/         # Technical execution plans
├── timelines/             # Project schedules and milestones
├── resources/             # Required assets and dependencies
└── validation/            # Success metrics and quality checks
```

## 🎭 3-Layer Tone System Implementation

### Layer Distribution Guidelines

**Creative-Heavy Content (Blog Posts, Vision Statements)**
- **35% Poetic**: Inspiring metaphors and consciousness imagery
- **45% User-Friendly**: Clear explanations connecting to human experience
- **20% Academic**: Technical backing and research citations

**Business-Focused Content (Landing Pages, Product Descriptions)**
- **25% Poetic**: Opening hooks that create emotional connection
- **50% User-Friendly**: Benefits and practical applications
- **25% Academic**: Specifications and technical validation

**Developer-Focused Content (Documentation, API Guides)**
- **20% Poetic**: Brief inspiring context and vision
- **35% User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and examples
- **45% Academic**: Detailed specifications and technical depth

### Writing Process Workflow

**1. Content Planning Phase**
- Identify target audience and appropriate tone distribution
- Select relevant constellation framework elements
- Choose vocabulary level from branding/vocabularies/
- Reference existing templates and patterns

**2. Content Creation Phase**
- Begin with poetic opening (≤40 words) that creates connection
- Build understanding through accessible explanations
- Provide technical depth that enables implementation
- Ensure smooth transitions between tone layers

**3. Quality Validation Phase**
- Check tone layer distribution percentages
- Validate vocabulary against standards
- Verify technical accuracy and evidence backing
- Test reading level appropriateness

## 🔧 Vocabulary & Standards Management

### Mandatory Terminology Standards

**Brand Names & Display**
- ✅ "LUKHAS AI" (primary brand reference)
- ✅ "MΛTRIZ" (display), "Matriz" (plain text)
- ✅ "LUKHΛS" (logos/wordmarks), "Lukhas" (body text)
- ❌ Never "LUKHAS AGI", "MATADA", or inconsistent Λ usage

**Technical Accuracy Requirements**
- ✅ "quantum-inspired algorithms", "bio-inspired computing"
- ✅ "consciousness simulation", "awareness modeling"
- ❌ Never "quantum processing", "biological processing", "true AI"

**Constellation Framework Symbols**
Use sparingly and only in poetic layer context:
- ⚛️ Identity (atomic uniqueness, crystalline authenticity)
- ✦ Memory (temporal coherence, causal preservation)
- 🔬 Vision (pattern recognition, perceptual clarity)
- 🌱 Bio (adaptive growth, organic resilience)
- 🌙 Dream (creative synthesis, symbolic processing)
- ⚖️ Ethics (balanced judgment, protective wisdom)
- 🛡️ Guardian (safety assurance, drift prevention)
- ⚛️ Quantum (uncertainty embraced, emergent possibility)

### Quality Validation Checklist

**Vocabulary Compliance**
- [ ] Brand names used consistently
- [ ] Technical accuracy maintained
- [ ] Superlatives avoided or evidence-backed
- [ ] Constellation symbols used appropriately
- [ ] Reading level matches target audience

**Tone Layer Validation**
- [ ] Poetic expressions ≤40 words
- [ ] Natural flow between layers maintained
- [ ] Target distribution percentages achieved
- [ ] Technical claims supported by evidence
- [ ] Accessibility preserved throughout
