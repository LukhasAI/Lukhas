# Lambda Products — Overview

This directory contains short docs and READMEs for each Lambda product in the LUKHΛS suite. The authoritative product content and visionary documents are archived in the repository root and the website markdown (see `LAMBDA_PRODUCTS_CONTENT.md` and `ARCHIVED_VISIONARY_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`).

Current product docs:
- `ARGUS.md` — DΛST (security dashboard)
- `SIGIL.md` — WΛLLET (identity & wallet)
- `NIAS.md` — Non-intrusive messaging (placeholder)
- `TRACE.md` — ΛTrace (quantum metadata engine) (placeholder)

How to contribute
-----------------
- Expand each product README with architecture notes, API contracts, and quickstart guides.
- Add design assets under `docs/assets/<product>` and link to roadmap items in `lukhas_website/LUKHΛS_STUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.
