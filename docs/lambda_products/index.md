# Lambda Products Documentation Index

Welcome — this index links to product READMEs and notes. Use these as starting points for deeper architecture and onboarding documentation.

- ARGUS — `ARGUS.md`
- SIGIL — `SIGIL.md`
- NIAS — `NIAS.md` (placeholder)
- TRACE — `TRACE.md` (placeholder)

To expand documentation: create `architecture.md`, `api.md` and `quickstart.md` under each product folder.
