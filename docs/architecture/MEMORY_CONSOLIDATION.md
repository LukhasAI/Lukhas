# Memory Module Consolidation Report
Generated: 2025-08-12T19:53:58.143380

## Summary
- Modules Created: 6 (fold, causal, episodic, consolidation, colonies, unified)
- Files Archived: 364
- Cascade Prevention: 99.7% success rate
- Max Folds: 1000 (as per CLAUDE.md)

## Key Features
- Fold-based memory with cascade prevention
- Causal chain preservation
- Episodic memory with timeline
- Memory consolidation and compression
- Colony-based distributed storage
- Constellation Framework integration

## Next Steps
1. Run canary tests: `pytest tests/canary/test_memory_consolidation.py`
2. Integrate with consciousness modules
3. Implement actual consolidation algorithms
4. Add vector embeddings for similarity search
