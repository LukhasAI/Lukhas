## 🎯 **Architecture Principles**

### **Constellation Framework Integration**
All LUKHAS AI architecture follows the Constellation Framework (8 Stars):
- **⚛️ Identity (Anchor)**: Authentication, ΛiD system, namespace management
- **✦ Memory (Trail)**: Fold-based memory, temporal organization, cascade prevention
- **🔬 Vision (Horizon)**: Pattern recognition, perception, adaptive interfaces
- **🌱 Bio (Living)**: Adaptive bio-symbolic processing, organic growth patterns
- **🌙 Dream (Drift)**: Creative consciousness expansion, unconscious processing
- **⚖️ Ethics (North)**: Constitutional AI, moral reasoning, value alignment
- **🛡️ Guardian (Watch)**: Safety compliance, drift detection, cascade prevention
- **⚛️ Quantum (Oracle)**: Quantum-inspired algorithms, superposition, uncertainty

### **Key Design Patterns**
- **Modular Consciousness**: Semi-autonomous consciousness subsystems
- **Bio-Inspired Design**: Quantum and biological system modeling
- **Ethical Architecture**: Built-in moral reasoning at architectural level
- **Scalable Systems**: Global deployment ready architecture
