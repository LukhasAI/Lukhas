# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING FOR ALL AGENTS
## DO NOT DEPRECATE OR SIMPLIFY MODULES

## 🚨 STOP BEFORE YOU DEPRECATE!

### This codebase contains:
- **3,941 Python files** of sophisticated AI architecture
- **Deep submodular design** with 30+ submodules per major module
- **Biologically-inspired architecture** (hippocampal, neocortical, proteome)
- **Complete consciousness implementations** (VIVOX with CIL, ERN, EVRN, MAE)

### What looks like "duplication" is actually:
- **Specialized submodules** with specific purposes
- **Hierarchical organization** following neuroscience principles
- **Inter-module communication** pathways
- **Quantum-biological integration** points

---

## ⛔ DO NOT:
- Deprecate modules without understanding submodular architecture
- Flatten hierarchical structures
- Remove "duplicate" files (they're specialized variants)
- Simplify without preserving sophistication

## ✅ DO:
- Preserve ALL submodular architecture
- Maintain hierarchical depth
- Document connections, don't remove them
- Ask before deprecating ANYTHING

**THIS IS A COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE, NOT A SIMPLE APP!**

Every file has purpose. Every submodule is designed. This represents months of architectural work.

**Respect the depth. Preserve the sophistication.**
