## Detailed Status
| # | Location | Line | Extract | Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | candidate/consciousness/reflection/reflection_layer.py | 837 | # Integration with actual dream engine is a TODO. | Blocked | Waiting on dream engine hookup | Dream simulation trigger cannot integrate with the external dream engine until the AID DreamReflectionLoop module is available. |
| 2 | candidate/consciousness/reflection/reflection_layer.py | 943 | triggered_dreams=[],  # TODO: Track dream IDs from reflection metadata | Deferred | Snapshot lacks dream metadata | ConscienceSnapshot currently stores an empty triggered_dreams list; it needs a future update once dream metadata is exposed by the reflection pipeline. |
| 3 | candidate/consciousness/reflection/reflection_layer.py | 944 | voice_alerts=[],  # TODO: Track voice alerts if vocalize_conscience returns specific alert IDs/info | Deferred | Voice alert tracking unavailable | Voice alert identifiers are not returned by vocalize_conscience yet, so the snapshot stores an empty list until the voice subsystem emits structured IDs. |
| 4 | candidate/consciousness/cognitive/adapter.py | 45 | # DESCRIPTION: Complete Cognitive Adapter with all TODOs resolved | Verified | Documentation indicates completion | Module header explicitly states the cognitive adapter TODOs were resolved; no outstanding implementation gaps were found. |
| 5 | candidate/consciousness/cognitive/adapter.py | 1014 | # STATUS: All TODOs resolved - complete implementation with configuration | Verified | Implementation marked complete | Footer commentary confirms configuration and TODO cleanup were finalized; nothing remains to action in this file. |
| 6 | candidate/consciousness/reflection/brain_integration.py | 108 | pass  # from BIO_SYMBOLIC.qi_attention import QIAttention  # TODO: Install or implement BIO_SYMBOLIC | Blocked | BIO_SYMBOLIC dependency missing | QIAttention import is stubbed with a pass because the BIO_SYMBOLIC package is not present in the repository. |

| 8 | candidate/consciousness/reflection/service.py | 248 | # TODO: Reconcile "LAMBDA_TIER_X" string constants with the global 0-5 integer tier system. | Deferred | Tier mapping reconciliation required | Capability configuration mixes LAMBDA_TIER_X string constants with numeric tiers.

| 15 | candidate/memory/temporal/documentation_analytics.py | 720 | if todos > 0: | Verified | Score penalty handled | Completeness scores already deduct five points per TODO occurrence, reflecting outstanding work in the final metric. |
| 16 | candidate/memory/temporal/documentation_analytics.py | 728 | if todos > 0: | Verified | Recommendations updated | When TODO markers exist the analyzer adds a recommendation reminding authors to complete those items. |
| 17 | candidate/memory/temporal/documentation_analytics.py | 729 | recommendations.append(f"Complete {todos} TODO items") | Verified | Reminder surfaced | The recommendation string explicitly instructs documentation owners to complete outstanding TODO entries. |
