# LUKHAS AI Development Roadmap

> **Note**: This is a solo developer project with AI assistance. Timelines are estimates and subject to change based on available resources and priorities.

## Project Philosophy

LUKHAS is an experimental research project exploring consciousness-inspired AI patterns. Development is iterative, with priorities shifting based on discoveries and collaborations.

## Current Status (November 2025)

### What's Working
- Basic lane architecture (candidate/core/lukhas)
- 964 tests with varying pass rates
- Experimental MCP servers for Claude Desktop
- Initial consciousness and memory modules
- Basic API structure

### Main Challenges
- 169 test collection errors to resolve
- MATRIZ case-sensitivity inconsistencies
- Import boundary violations
- Performance not meeting targets
- Documentation gaps

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Fix critical issues and establish stable foundation

- [ ] Resolve all test collection errors
- [ ] Fix MATRIZ case naming consistency
- [ ] Clean up import violations
- [ ] Document existing functionality
- [ ] Improve error handling

**Realistic Timeline**: 3-6 months for solo developer

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Q2-Q3 2026)
**Goal**: Complete core systems to working prototype level

- [ ] MATRIZ engine basic functionality
- [ ] Memory system improvements (target: 99% cascade prevention)
- [ ] Guardian system basic implementation
- [ ] API stability improvements
- [ ] Basic performance optimization

**Realistic Timeline**: 6-9 months

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Q4 2026)
**Goal**: Integrate components and improve reliability

- [ ] Component integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Example applications

**Realistic Timeline**: 3-6 months

### Phase 4: Collaboration & Licensing (2027)
**Goal**: Open for partnerships and commercial licensing

- [ ] Partnership framework
- [ ] Licensing model refinement
- [ ] Academic collaboration program
- [ ] Commercial pilot projects
- [ ] Community feedback integration

**Realistic Timeline**: Ongoing

## Not Planned (Realistic Limitations)

Given solo developer constraints, the following are NOT planned:

- Full production deployment
- Enterprise-grade SLAs
- 24/7 support
- Comprehensive documentation for all modules
- Performance guarantees

## Collaboration Opportunities

We're actively seeking:
- Academic research partners
- Technical collaborators
- Commercial pilot customers
- Funding for dedicated development

Contact: licensing@lukhas.ai

## Version Milestones

### v0.1.0 - Foundation (Current)
- Basic architecture established
- Core concepts proven
- Initial testing framework

### v0.2.0 - Stabilization (Target: Q2 2026)
- Critical bugs resolved
- Core functionality stable
- Basic documentation complete

### v0.3.0 - Integration (Target: Q4 2026)
- Components integrated
- Performance baselines established
- Security review completed

### v1.0.0 - Collaboration Ready (Target: 2027)
- Stable enough for partnerships
- Licensing model active
- Core features documented

## How to Track Progress

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug tracking and feature requests
- **Commits**: Daily development activity
- **Tests**: Watch test pass rates improve
- **Documentation**: Gradual improvement in /docs

## Contributing to the Roadmap

While this is proprietary software, we welcome:
- Bug reports (via issues)
- Feature suggestions
- Partnership proposals
- Collaboration ideas

Contact licensing@lukhas.ai to discuss involvement.

## Disclaimer

This roadmap represents current intentions but is subject to change. As a research project by a solo developer, timelines are estimates only. Commercial users should contact us to discuss specific requirements and realistic delivery schedules.
