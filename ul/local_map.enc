# Local Symbol Map Storage
# ========================
# This file represents the encrypted local storage for personal symbol mappings.
# In production, this would be an encrypted database or secure enclave.
#
# Format: JSON encrypted with user's device key
# Never synchronized to server - completely local
#
# Example structure (when decrypted):
# {
#   "version": "1.0",
#   "user_lid": "gonzo",
#   "symbols": [
#     {
#       "symbol_id": "sym_abc123",
#       "symbol_type": "emoji",
#       "symbol_hash": "a3f2b8...",
#       "salt": "rnd_salt_xyz",
#       "meaning_type": "emotion",
#       "meaning_value": "calm",
#       "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
#       "last_used_at": "2024-01-16T14:30:00Z",
#       "use_count": 5,
#       "quality_score": 0.85
#     }
#   ],
#   "compositions": [
#     {
#       "composition_id": "comp_def456",
#       "name": "approval_gesture",
#       "symbols": ["sym_abc123", "sym_xyz789"],
#       "operators": ["+"],
#       "meaning": "strong_approval",
#       "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
# - Key derived from user's device biometrics + PIN
# - Automatic re-encryption on each write
# - Tamper detection via HMAC
# - No cloud backup - regenerate if lost

# This is a placeholder for the encrypted symbol map
# Actual implementation would use proper encryption
