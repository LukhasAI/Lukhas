  # Test Request (ΛBot)

  **Target file:** `serve/main.py`
  **Tier:** 1
  **Rationale:** low coverage + high usage signal

  ## Requirements
  - Deterministic tests (freeze time, seeds; no sleeps)
  - Mock external IO (network, LLMs, stores)
  - Focus edge cases + error contracts
  - Coverage target: 85%

  ## Notes
  - Protected surface must not be edited.
  - Use the prompt in `prompts/labot/serve_main.md`.
  - This PR is a **draft** from ΛBot and requires human review before merging.
