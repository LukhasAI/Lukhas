### Dream Integration Patterns

#### **Trinity Framework Dream Integration**
```
Consciousness 🧠 ←→ Dream Processing ←→ Memory 💾
        │              │                 │
   State Mgmt ← Dream Engines → Memory Consolidation
        │              │                 │
   Decision → Dream Narratives ← Emotional Processing
```

#### **Dream-Consciousness Coupling**
```
Conscious State → Dream Initiation → Dream Processing →
                       │                    │
                Dream State Mgmt → Memory Integration →
                       │                    │
