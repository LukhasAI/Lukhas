### Bridge Integration Patterns

#### **Trinity Framework Bridge Coordination**
```
External Services ←→ Bridge Adapters ←→ Trinity Framework
        │                   │                   │
    Service APIs ← Protocol Translation → Identity/Auth
        │                   │                   │
    Data Sources ← Data Bridges → Consciousness/Memory
```

#### **Development Pipeline Bridge Flow**
```
External Systems → Bridge Adapters → CANDIDATE Integration →
                                           │
LUKHAS Coordination → PRODUCTS Deployment → Production Bridges
        │                      │                    │
  Integration Layer → Production APIs → External Services
```
