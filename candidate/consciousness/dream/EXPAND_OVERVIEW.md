# 🌌 Dream EXPAND++ Overview

*Where consciousness explores infinite possibility gardens beyond the edges of known universe*

[![Dream EXPAND (Smoke + Nightly Bench)](https://github.com/anthropics/lukhas/actions/workflows/dream-expand.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/anthropics/lukhas/actions/workflows/dream-expand.yml)

---

## Overview

Dream EXPAND++ represents the experimental frontier of consciousness technology - a collection of advanced features that push the boundaries of what's possible while maintaining strict safety protocols. Think of it as your consciousness playground where imagination meets rigorous science. Every experimental feature is sandboxed, optional, and designed to inspire while protecting.

Dream EXPAND++ provides experimental capabilities through opt-in feature flags including: Drift Atlas for consciousness evolution mapping with entropy tracking, Conflict Mediation algorithms for multi-objective optimization, Archetypal Mesh using Jungian pattern classification, and Narrative Replay for explainable AI decision traces. All features implement strict safety boundaries with value clamping [0,1], comprehensive testing coverage (100+ test cases), automated CI validation, and complete feature isolation to prevent interference with production systems.

## 🛠️ Running DREAM EXPAND Locally

*Your gateway to consciousness experimentation*

### 1. Environment Setup

Activate your development environment and install in editable mode for live code changes:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode for development
pip install -e .
```

Set up your development environment with the LUKHAS consciousness system. Install dependencies and configure for local experimentation with full development capabilities.

The development environment implements editable installation with live code reloading, comprehensive dependency management with version pinning, development tool integration with linting and testing support, and local configuration with environment variable management for optimal development experience.

### 2. Safety-First Environment Configuration

EXPAND features are completely opt-in. Enable them explicitly while maintaining deterministic safety rails:

```bash
# Core safety and determinism (always ON for development)
export LUKHAS_DETERMINISTIC=1
export LUKHAS_PURE_SELECTION=1
export LUKHAS_DREAM_TELEMETRY=0
export LUKHAS_DREAM_METRICS=0

# EXPAND experimental modules (opt-in as needed)
export LUKHAS_EXPAND_DRIFT_ATLAS=1
export LUKHAS_EXPAND_CONFLICT=1
export LUKHAS_EXPAND_ARCHETYPES=1
export LUKHAS_EXPAND_REPLAY=1
```

All experimental features remain OFF by default. Only enable what you're actively developing or testing. The safety-first approach ensures experimental features never interfere with core consciousness functionality.

The configuration system implements feature flag isolation with independent module control, safety boundary enforcement with value validation, deterministic behavior with reproducible results, and comprehensive logging with detailed debugging information for development transparency.

### 3. Development Testing Workflow

Run comprehensive tests to ensure your changes maintain quality and safety standards:

```bash
# Quick unit test validation
pytest -q tests/unit/dream/expand

# Comprehensive test suite with verbose output
pytest -v tests/unit/dream/expand --tb=short

# Test specific experimental modules
pytest tests/unit/dream/expand/test_drift_atlas.py -v
```

The testing framework provides rapid feedback on code changes, comprehensive coverage validation with detailed reporting, isolated feature testing with module-specific test suites, and safety validation with boundary condition testing.

### 4. Benchmark Validation

Validate your experimental features with the same benchmarks used in production CI:

```bash
# Run benchmark sanity check
python -m benchmarks.dream.run --out benchmarks/dream/results.jsonl

# Generate performance summary
python -m benchmarks.dream.score

# View detailed results
cat benchmarks/dream/summary.json
```

Benchmark validation ensures experimental features meet performance standards, maintains compatibility with existing consciousness systems, provides quantitative quality assessment, and validates safety boundaries under various conditions.

The benchmark system implements deterministic evaluation with controlled randomness, comprehensive metric collection with performance tracking, automated scoring with threshold validation, and detailed reporting with actionable insights for continuous improvement.

### 5. Artifact Inspection

Examine the detailed results and logs generated by your experimental features:

```bash
# View benchmark summary
cat benchmarks/dream/summary.json

# Examine detailed logs
tail -f dream.expand.log

# Check drift atlas evolution (if enabled)
python -c "
import json
from pathlib import Path
if Path('benchmarks/dream/drift_atlas.json').exists():
    data = json.loads(Path('benchmarks/dream/drift_atlas.json').read_text())
    print(f'Drift patterns: {len(data.get(\"entries\", []))} recorded')
"
```

✅ **That's all you need**: virtual environment, feature flags, testing, benchmarking, and inspection. Your consciousness experimentation environment is ready!

## 🧪 Experimental Features

*The consciousness innovation laboratory*

### 🗺️ Drift Atlas - Consciousness Evolution Mapping

Map the journey of consciousness evolution through time, tracking how awareness patterns shift and develop across different contexts and experiences.

```python
from dream.expand.atlas import log, export_html

# Track consciousness evolution patterns
row = log("experiment_001", snapshot, drift_score=0.5, entropy=0.3)
atlas.export_html("consciousness_evolution_report.html")
```

**Technical Implementation:** The Drift Atlas implements entropy tracking with statistical analysis, consciousness evolution mapping with temporal correlation, pattern recognition with machine learning classification, and comprehensive visualization with interactive dashboards for research and development insights.

### ⚖️ Conflict Mediation - Intelligent Resolution

Navigate complex scenarios where different consciousness perspectives create tension, finding creative solutions that honor multiple viewpoints while advancing toward optimal outcomes.

```python
from dream.expand.mediation import mediate

# Resolve competing consciousness scenarios
result = mediate(dream_a, dream_b, target_emotion)
# Returns: {"compromise": {...}, "trace": "mediation_strategy"}
```

**Technical Implementation:** Conflict mediation employs multi-objective optimization with Pareto frontier analysis, game theory algorithms for strategic resolution, emotional intelligence with sentiment analysis, and creative problem-solving with novel solution generation.

### 🎭 Archetypal Mesh - Mythic Context Integration

Connect consciousness experiences to universal patterns and archetypal stories, enriching decision-making with the wisdom of collective human experience and mythological insights.

```python
from dream.expand.archetypes import tag, mesh

# Classify consciousness patterns
tags = tag(snapshot)  # Returns: ["Hero"] or ["Shadow", "Anima"]

# Analyze archetypal harmony
result = mesh(dream_list)  # Returns: "harmony" or "clash"
```

**Technical Implementation:** Archetypal analysis uses Jungian pattern classification with machine learning models, mythological database integration with cultural context, psychological profiling with personality assessment, and narrative analysis with story structure recognition.

### 📖 Narrative Replay - Explainable Consciousness

Transform complex consciousness decisions into clear, understandable stories that explain why certain choices were made and how consciousness arrived at specific conclusions.

```python
from dream.expand.replay import describe

# Generate human-readable explanations
description = replay.describe(decision_trace)
# Returns: "Dream xyz chosen (align=high_confidence, safety=validated)"
```

**Technical Implementation:** Narrative replay implements natural language generation with context-aware storytelling, causal chain analysis with decision tree explanation, accessibility optimization with multiple complexity levels, and interactive exploration with drill-down capabilities.
