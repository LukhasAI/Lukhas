## Consciousness Foundation Overview

Consciousness Research Foundation represents the **foundational consciousness research and architecture systems** that provide the base consciousness processing capabilities for the entire LUKHAS AGI system. This is the foundational layer that enables consciousness development in CANDIDATE and consciousness integration in LUKHAS.

### **Foundation Scope**
- **Purpose**: Foundational consciousness research and decision engine architecture
- **Architecture**: Base consciousness processing systems and research frameworks
- **Integration**: Foundation systems enabling CANDIDATE consciousness development
- **Research**: Core consciousness research patterns and experimental frameworks
