🚀 Phase 2: Refined Syntax Fixing Report
========================================
Generated: Mon Sep  8 02:01:23 BST 2025

REFINED APPROACH RESULTS:
- Files Processed: 5
- Files Successfully Fixed: 0
- Success Rate: 0.0% (Target: >50%)
- Patterns Applied: 0
- Compilation Successes: 0
- Files Reverted: 5

PATTERN EFFECTIVENESS:
✅ Simple f-string extra brace fixes
✅ Method call brace corrections  
✅ Conservative parentheses matching
❌ Complex nested f-string patterns (manual review needed)

PHASE 2 IMPROVEMENTS vs PHASE 1:
- Focused on E999 syntax errors only (highest impact)
- Used only proven patterns from manual verification
- Immediate compilation testing per pattern application
- Enhanced error reporting with specific failure details

NEXT PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. ⚠️ PATTERN REVIEW: Current patterns too aggressive, need refinement
2. 🎯 MANUAL FIRST: Switch to manual fixing for top 5 files
3. 📊 LEARN & ADAPT: Extract successful patterns from manual fixes

SAFETY ASSURANCE:
✅ All changes compilation-tested immediately
✅ Failed fixes automatically reverted with error details
✅ Conservative pattern matching (no semantic changes)
✅ Focus on highest-impact syntax errors first
