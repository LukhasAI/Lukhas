## 📋 Copy-Paste Brief for Any Component

**"I need you to develop [COMPONENT]. Use the complete development context in `/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`. All documentation, existing implementations, and architecture requirements are mapped there. Focus on Trinity Framework compliance (⚛️🧠🛡️), QI-enhanced processing, and production-ready code with comprehensive testing. Start by reading the complete implementation directory and architecture guide."**
