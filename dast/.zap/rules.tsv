# Temporarily ignore CSP warnings until ABAS policies ship
# Our minimal CSP is compatible with FastAPI/Swagger, will tune post-deployment
10054	IGNORE	CSP intentionally minimal for FastAPI/Swagger compatibility - will strengthen with ABAS

# Ignore timestamp disclosure in API responses (expected behavior)
10096	IGNORE	Timestamp in responses is intentional for API debugging and observability

# Ignore modern web app info message (not a vulnerability)
10109	IGNORE	Informational only - acknowledges modern framework usage
