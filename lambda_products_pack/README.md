```

### Integrated Ecosystem Example
```python
from lambda_products import NIΛS, ΛBAS, DΛST, ΛLens, WΛLLET

# Initialize integrated system
nias = NIΛS()  # Message filtering
abas = ΛBAS()  # Attention management  
dast = DΛST()  # Context tracking
lens = ΛLens() # Content analysis
wallet = WΛLLET() # Identity management

# Register user across all systems
user_id = "alice"
await nias.register_user(user_id, MessageTier.CREATIVE, ConsentLevel.ENHANCED)
await abas.register_user(user_id, AttentionState.AVAILABLE)
await dast.register_user(user_id, ["working", "focused"])

# Context-aware message delivery
current_context = await dast.get_current_tags(user_id)
attention_available = abas.is_attention_available(user_id)

if attention_available and "deep-work" in current_context:
    # User is available and in deep work - only allow focused messages
    filtered_result = await nias.push_message(message, user_id)
