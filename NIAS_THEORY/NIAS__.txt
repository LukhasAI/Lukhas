How NIAS Ai Works in Detail: ( NON INTRUSIVE ADS)

	1.	Data Collection & Analysis:
	•	User Behavior Tracking: NIAS Ai collects data based on user actions like browsing history, purchase habits, and content engagement across platforms.
	•	AI Algorithms: The AI processes this data in real-time, creating a user profile that includes preferences, interests, and purchasing likelihood.
	2.	Ad Personalization:
	•	Real-Time Recommendations: NIAS Ai uses machine learning to recommend highly relevant products or services. Ads adapt to each user, displaying the most relevant options at the optimal time.
	•	Dynamic Content: Ads change dynamically based on the user’s interactions and preferences, keeping the experience fresh and tailored. For example, if a user shows interest in smartwatches, the AI will prioritize related ads.
	3.	Revenue Generation:
	•	Ad Impressions & Clicks: Free-tier users will see ads at regular intervals. These generate revenue through traditional ad models like impressions (cost-per-mille) or clicks (cost-per-click).
	•	Commission-Based Sales: Businesses using NIAS Ai will pay a percentage commission (3% to 10%) on sales made through AI-powered ad placements, providing a second stream of revenue.
	4.	User Engagement:
	•	Ad Engagement Analytics: Each ad includes an ‘ad relevance score’ and a ‘predicted interest’ indicator, giving users a sense of how closely the product matches their preferences.
	•	Call-to-Action: The interface features simple, user-friendly CTAs like ‘Buy Now,’ allowing users to easily engage with and purchase products.
