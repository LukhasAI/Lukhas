## Pre-Migration Checklist (required before any MATRIZ migration)
> **All items below MUST be satisfied and validated before starting a production package migration.**
- **CI Simplification merged**: `chore/simplify-ci-pr` (Tier1 CI active).  *(Blocking)*
- **Compatibility shim validated**: `MATRIZ/__init__.py` present and `make smoke` passes on macOS-like environment. Attach smoke log.
- **AST rewriter dry-run attached**: Dry patch for the package must be present in `migration_artifacts/matriz/<package>/`. Reviewer must inspect before apply.
- **Local validations pass**: `make smoke`, `./scripts/run_lane_guard_worktree.sh` (worktree) must PASS locally. Attach `lane_guard_run_localfix.log`.
- **Usage monitor active**: `.github/workflows/usage-monitor.yml` added and last weekly run is OK (no >75% warning) or mitigations planned.
- **Rollback plan prepared**: pre-created rollback PR that reinstates `MATRIZ/__init__` shim and reverts the migration commit. Provide `git revert` command in the PR description.
- **Owner & Reviewer assigned**: Each migration PR must list an owner and at least one reviewer with merge rights (e.g., `@owner_core`).
- **Risk note**: If any step fails, abort the migration, revert any partial commits, and record failure notes in the PR.

- **Artifact retention**: Default `retention-days: 7` for transient artifacts; **90 days** for SLSA/attestation artifacts.
- **Matrix pruning**: Replace Cartesian matrices with `strategy.matrix.include` for meaningful combos only.
- **PR Requirements**: Every migration PR must attach: dry-run patch, `smoke.log`, `lane_guard_run_localfix.log`, and a rollback line in the PR body.
