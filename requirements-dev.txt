# DEV ENV NOTE:
# Development tooling (lint, static analysis, security scanners) often
# requires newer transitive dependencies than the runtime. To avoid
# impossible resolver conflicts we maintain separate lockfiles:
#  - `requirements.lock.txt` (runtime)  <-- generated in CI image with libpq/openssl
#  - `requirements-dev.lock.txt` (dev)   <-- generated by developers or CI for dev tools
# See `ci/README.md` for the recommended CI image setup and lockfile workflow.

# Align transitive pins with runtime requirements to avoid resolver conflicts
# Note: runtime and dev environments may require different transitive versions
# (for example `semgrep` currently requires urllib3~=2.0). We keep runtime pins
# strict in `requirements.txt` and allow the dev lockfile to resolve dev-only
# tools independently to avoid impossible constraints during resolution.
# If you need a single aligned lockfile for both, install/build in a CI image
# that provides native build deps (libpq / OpenSSL) or remove conflicting dev
# tools from the combined lockfile.

# Keep cachetools/packaging/psycopg pins aligned where needed; remove the
# strict urllib3 pin which conflicts with semgrep's requirements.
