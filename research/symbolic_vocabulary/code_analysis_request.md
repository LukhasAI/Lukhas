# LUKHAS Symbolic Vocabulary Analysis Request

## Current Implementation

Here is our current symbolic vocabulary implementation from `symbolic/core/__init__.py`:

```python
# Placeholder classes for backwards compatibility
class Symbol:
    """Placeholder Symbol class for backwards compatibility."""
    def __init__(self, name="", value=None):
        self.name = name
        self.value = value


class SymbolicVocabulary:
    """Placeholder SymbolicVocabulary class for backwards compatibility."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.symbols = {}


def get_symbolic_vocabulary():
    """Get symbolic vocabulary instance. Placeholder implementation."""
    return SymbolicVocabulary()
```

## LUKHAS Architecture Context

This is part of the LUKHAS AI system which implements:
- Quantum-inspired consciousness architecture
- MATRIZ cognitive DNA processing
- Constellation Framework (⚛️ Identity · ✦ Memory · 🔬 Vision · 🌱 Bio · 🌙 Dream · ⚖️ Ethics · 🛡️ Guardian · ⚛️ Quantum)
- Bio-inspired symbolic processing
- Neuro-symbolic integration

## Requirements for Expert Analysis

We need these placeholder classes replaced with research-backed implementations that include:
1. Quantum-inspired symbolic representation
2. Consciousness-aware vocabulary management
3. Bio-inspired learning patterns
4. Integration with neuro-symbolic architectures
5. Support for symbolic reasoning and inference
6. Professional-grade implementation suitable for website publication

## Technical Environment

- Python 3.9-3.11
- Integration with LUKHAS consciousness systems
- MATRIZ node compatibility
- Memory system integration
- Production deployment readiness
