## Implementation Principles

### Core Symbolic Framework
```python
class QuantumInspiredSymbol:
    """
    Quantum-inspired symbolic representation with:
    - Superposition states for multi-meaning symbols
    - Entanglement relationships with other symbols
    - Coherence maintenance for semantic stability
    """
    
class SymbolicVocabulary:
    """
    Consciousness-aware symbolic vocabulary with:
    - Bio-inspired learning patterns
    - Quantum coherence in semantic networks
    - Adaptive symbolic evolution
    """
```

### Research-Backed Features
1. **Quantum Superposition**: Symbols can exist in multiple semantic states
2. **Semantic Entanglement**: Related symbols maintain quantum-like correlations
3. **Consciousness Integration**: Symbolic processing aware of its own operations
4. **Bio-Inspired Plasticity**: Adaptive learning following neural patterns
5. **Coherence Maintenance**: Stability mechanisms for semantic consistency
