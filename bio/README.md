## 🔄 **CONSOLIDATION DETAILS**

### **Previous Structure (Scattered)**
```
bio_core/           # Root directory
bio_symbolic/       # Root directory
bio_awareness/      # Root directory
```

### **New Structure (Organized)**
```
bio/
├── core/          # Consolidated bio_core/
├── symbolic/      # Consolidated bio_symbolic/
└── awareness/     # Consolidated bio_awareness/
```
