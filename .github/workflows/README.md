# 🎯 LUKHAS T4/0.01% Excellence CI/CD Pipeline

This directory contains the production-grade CI/CD workflows for LUKHAS AI, implementing T4/0.01% excellence standards.

## 🛡️ Security Gates (`security-gates.yml`)

**Trigger**: All PRs and pushes to main/develop
**Purpose**: Enforce security standards and prevent vulnerabilities

### Security Checks:
- **Semgrep Security Scanning**: Custom rules for LUKHAS-specific vulnerabilities
- **MockGuardian Detection**: Prevents MockGuardian usage in production code paths
- **Guardian Validation**: Ensures ProductionGuardian is correctly configured
- **Rate Limiting Security**: Validates rate limiting implementation
- **Token Security**: Tests OWASP ASVS Level 2 compliance

### Success Criteria:
- Zero critical security findings
- No MockGuardian detected in production paths
- Guardian correctly configured for production mode
- Rate limiting properly enforced
- Token validation meets OWASP standards

## ⚡ Performance Gates (`performance-gates.yml`)

**Trigger**: All PRs and pushes to main/develop
**Purpose**: Enforce T4/0.01% performance standards

### Performance Validation:
- **WebAuthn Latency**: <100ms P95
- **API Latency**: <500ms P95
- **Orchestration Latency**: <250ms P95
- **Memory Operations**: <50ms P95
- **Error Rate**: <0.01%

### Test Coverage:
- WebAuthn registration/authentication performance
- Multi-AI orchestration routing performance
- Memory system fold operations performance
- API load testing and latency validation
- Memory stress testing and efficiency

## 🎯 T4/0.01% Excellence Validation (`t4-excellence-validation.yml`)

**Trigger**: PRs to main, main branch pushes, daily schedule
**Purpose**: Comprehensive excellence standard validation

### Excellence Criteria:
- All security gates pass
- All performance targets met
- Production Guardian active
- Rate limiting operational
- Memory system within limits
- Monitoring and alerting configured

### Integration Testing:
- End-to-end system validation
- Cross-component performance testing
- Production readiness verification
- Long-term excellence monitoring

## 📊 Guardian Validation (`guardian-check.yml`)

**Trigger**: All code changes
**Purpose**: Ensure Guardian system integrity

### Validation Steps:
- Environment-aware Guardian selection
- Policy enforcement testing
- Production mode verification
- Security compliance checking
