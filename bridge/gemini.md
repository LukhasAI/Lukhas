# Bridge Systems & Adapters
## External Integration & Cross-System Communication

### Bridge Overview
- **Purpose**: External system integration and cross-system communication bridges
- **Architecture**: API adapters, service bridges, protocol translation layers
- **Integration**: CANDIDATE development to LUKHAS integration coordination
- **Scale**: Bridge systems enabling external service and system connectivity

### Core Bridge Architecture

#### **API Integration Bridges** - External Service Connectivity
- RESTful API adapters and service integration layers
- OAuth2/OIDC authentication bridges for external services
- API rate limiting, retry logic, and error handling systems
- Service discovery and health monitoring integration

#### **AI Service Bridges** - Multi-AI Provider Integration
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI service adapters
- Multi-provider AI orchestration and routing systems
- Consensus algorithms for multi-AI decision making
- AI service fallback and redundancy mechanisms

#### **Data Service Bridges** - External Data Integration
- Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox integration adapters
- File system bridges and document processing adapters
- Database connectivity and data synchronization bridges
- Real-time data streaming and webhook integration

#### **Protocol Translation** - Cross-System Communication
- Protocol adaptation between different communication standards
- Message format translation and serialization bridges
- Legacy system integration and modernization adapters
- Cross-platform communication protocol bridges

### Bridge Integration Patterns

#### **Trinity Framework Bridge Coordination**
```
External Services ←→ Bridge Adapters ←→ Trinity Framework
        │                   │                   │
    Service APIs ← Protocol Translation → Identity/Auth
        │                   │                   │
    Data Sources ← Data Bridges → Consciousness/Memory
```

#### **Development Pipeline Bridge Flow**
```
External Systems → Bridge Adapters → CANDIDATE Integration →
                                           │
LUKHAS Coordination → PRODUCTS Deployment → Production Bridges
        │                      │                    │
  Integration Layer → Production APIs → External Services
```
