Complete integration of enhanced regulation policy engine with sophisticated
audit logging into the AkaQualia consciousness system.

Key Integration Points:
- Replace simple regulate() method with RegulationPolicyEngine
- Enhanced policy generation with configurable heuristic rules
- Comprehensive audit trail logging for regulation decisions
- Energy-aware sublimation actions with conservation tracking
- Post-regulation energy accounting and audit entry updates

Technical Implementation:
- RegulationPolicyEngine initialized in AkaQualia.__init__
- Updated regulate() method returns (RegulationPolicy, RegulationAuditEntry)
- Energy accounting integrated with audit trail system
- Conservation violation tracking separated from EnergySnapshot
- Status reporting includes regulation audit statistics

Features Added:
- Policy caching with TTL for performance optimization
- Configurable rule thresholds for different scenarios
- Conservative mode for preemptive regulation
- Decision rationale tracking for transparency
- Performance metrics for policy generation timing

Energy Accounting Preserved:
- Before/after energy snapshots computed correctly
- Conservation violations tracked independently
- Energy delta validation with configurable tolerance
- VIVOX integration maintained for drift monitoring

This completes Wave B-B3: "Build regulation policy v1 with logging"
with sophisticated audit trail and heuristic policy generation integrated
into the main consciousness cycle while maintaining energy accounting
and VIVOX integration.

- **Agent 5**: Syntax/Imports (critical error resolution)

## 📋 Updated Instructions
- **JULES_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Marked T4-AUTOFIX complete, prioritized serve/ tests
- **JULES_SAFE_TEST_TASKS.md**: Clear focus on 19 untested serve/ modules
- **system_status_comprehensive_report.py**: Updated TODO[T4-AUTOFIX] status

## 🛡️ Conflict Prevention System
- Separate feature branches for each agent
- Wave C aka_qualia/ avoidance protocols
- ≤20 lines patch limits per file
- Quality gate validation (make jules-gate)

## 📊 Expected Combined Impact
- **Test Coverage**: +20% system-wide (serve/ 0→70%, lukhas/ gaps filled)
- **Code Quality**: 30% reduction in Ruff errors (50+ files improved)
- **Type Safety**: 40% reduction in MyPy errors
- **Stability**: Zero syntax errors, all imports resolved

## 🚀 Deployment Ready
Each agent has complete instructions, success metrics, and validation protocols.
Ready for parallel deployment across 5 specialized branches.

Note: Pre-commit issues in system_status_comprehensive_report.py demonstrate
exactly why Agent 4 (MyPy) and Agent 5 (Syntax/Imports) are needed.
