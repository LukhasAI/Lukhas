🚀 Universal Wrapper System:
- tools/ci/run_with_indicator.py - Progress spinner, heartbeat, timeout control
- Wraps LUKHAS-LLM analysis with visual feedback and monitoring
- Configurable timeout via LUKHAS_LLM_TIMEOUT environment variable

🔧 Pre-commit Integration:
- Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml to use wrapper for LLM analysis
- Enhanced with lukhas-llm-analyzer hook using run_with_indicator.py

📊 VS Code Monitoring:
- Added 'T4: Watch LLM Heartbeat' task for real-time monitoring
- Added 'T4: Kill LLM Analyzer' task for stuck process cleanup
- Keybindings: Cmd+Shift+H (watch), Cmd+Shift+K (kill)

📋 Log Location Guide:
- Created comprehensive LUKHAS_LOG_LOCATIONS_AND_ISSUES_GUIDE.md
- Documents where logs are saved: reports/, security-reports/, terminal output
- Current lint issues: 13,000+ total (F821, syntax errors, ARG002 top issues)
- Commands for viewing and analyzing specific issue types

🛠️ Utility Scripts:
- tools/ci/find_logs_and_issues.py - Log finder and issue analyzer
- tools/ci/test_wrapper.py - Test script for wrapper validation

Benefits:
✅ No more 'frozen' LLM analysis - clear progress indicators
✅ Timeout protection prevents infinite hangs
✅ Heartbeat monitoring for process health
✅ One-keystroke process management
✅ Clear documentation of log locations and current issues","security_scan":"pending"}
