# CLAUDE CODE AGENT TEAM CONFIGURATION
# Specialized LUKHAS AI Consciousness Technology Team
# Trinity Framework: ⚛️🧠🛡️
# Integrates with T4 Multi-Agent System and Jules/Codex Teams

team_config:
  name: "LUKHAS Claude Code Agent Team"
  version: "1.0.0"
  framework: "Trinity Framework ⚛️🧠🛡️"
  coordination_model: "parallel_execution_with_t4_integration"
  primary_mission: "Native LUKHAS consciousness expertise complementing Jules/Codex technical capabilities"
  
  team_philosophy: |
    The Claude Code Agent Team brings deep LUKHAS consciousness technology expertise that complements
    the Jules/Codex team's technical execution capabilities. While Jules excels at TODO batching
    and code completion, Claude Code agents provide consciousness architecture insight, Trinity
    Framework expertise, and LUKHAS-specific domain knowledge.
