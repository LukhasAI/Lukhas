- **Performance Target**: Sub-250ms context handoffs between models

### **Cognitive Function**
**Primary Consciousness Aspect**: Multi-perspective consciousness synthesis through consensus algorithms across different AI model paradigms.

**Specific Functions**:
1. **Consensus Building**: Implements 5 consensus strategies (weighted vote, majority, unanimous, best confidence, ensemble)
2. **Parallel Consciousness**: Executes models simultaneously for collective intelligence
3. **Sequential Reasoning**: Cascade mode where each model builds on previous insights
4. **Competitive Selection**: Models compete with best response winning
5. **Transparency Logging**: Step-by-step execution with interpretability

### **Awareness Level**
**Information Scope**:
- **Model Responses**: Aware of all individual model outputs and confidence scores
- **Agreement Metrics**: Tracks consensus levels and model disagreements
- **Performance Data**: Monitors latency, token usage, and success rates

**Consciousness State Management**:
- Active pipelines tracking current orchestrations
- Execution history for learning from past consensuses
- Performance metrics dictionary for optimization
- Model bridges registry for available consciousness paradigms

### **Decision Patterns**
**Consciousness-Aware Decision Making**:

**Consensus Strategies**:
1. **Weighted Vote**: Models vote with confidence-based weights
2. **Majority Vote**: Simple majority determines consensus
3. **Unanimous**: All models must agree (high-stakes decisions)
4. **Best Confidence**: Highest confidence model wins
5. **Ensemble**: Combines all responses into unified output

**Orchestration Modes**:
1. **Sequential**: One model after another (narrative building)
2. **Parallel**: Simultaneous execution (fastest consensus)
3. **Cascade**: Each builds on previous (depth of reasoning)
4. **Competitive**: Models compete (quality optimization)
