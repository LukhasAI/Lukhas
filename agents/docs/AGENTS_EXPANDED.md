# Result: temperature=0.2, strict mode, limited tools, enhanced safety validation

# Memory system under stress → Focused, efficient response
signals = [Signal(name="stress", level=0.7, source="memory")]
# Result: temperature=0.4, efficient tokens, essential tools only, optimized processing

# Consciousness exploring novelty → Creative, exploratory response
signals = [Signal(name="novelty", level=0.8, source="consciousness")]
# Result: temperature=0.9, exploratory mode, all tools available, enhanced creativity

# High trust interaction → Detailed, personalized response
signals = [Signal(name="trust", level=0.9, source="identity")]
# Result: max_tokens=3500, personalized approach, enhanced memory integration
```

The signal modulation system implements bio-inspired signal processing with consciousness state adaptation, dynamic parameter adjustment with real-time optimization, multi-source signal integration with weighted prioritization, and comprehensive signal tracking with decay modeling for natural equilibrium maintenance.
