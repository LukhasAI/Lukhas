# LUKHAS Public Vocabulary

**Stance-based language for all public-facing use**

*Extracted from the dual-stream lexicon for safe public deployment*

## Identity Vocabulary

Identity here is rhythm, not mask. It holds shape while allowing change.

- **anchors** → who is speaking, verified
- **permissions** → what is shared, with consent
- **traces** → the path of choices
- **boundaries** → the lines that protect dignity

Identity is a living negotiation: coherence with space for change.

## Memory Vocabulary

Memory is not a vault but a field.

- **folds** → layers reopened and compressed
- **echoes** → fragments returning
- **drift** → stored material changing over time
- **anchors** → points of verified recall
- **erosion** → the natural or chosen fading of access

Forgetting matters as much as recall. Both keep memory alive.

---

## Vision Vocabulary

Vision is orientation, not spectacle.

- **aperture** → the opening or closing of focus
- **focus** → sharpening detail
- **peripheral_field** → margins where surprises live
- **drift_gaze** → wandering into discovery
- **signal_to_shape** → noise finding form

Vision is practice: naming what is seen, noting what is not.

---

## Bio Vocabulary

We borrow from life, carefully.

- **energy_budget** → resources used with care
- **repair_cycle** → recovery after disruption
- **adaptation** → change that keeps integrity
- **resilience** → bending, not breaking
- **decay** → endings that allow renewal

Systems, like living things, must endure and return.

## Dream Vocabulary

Dreams are a second way of thinking, where logic loosens and new links appear.

- **drift_phase** → recombining memory
- **false_injection** → suggestion bending a dream
- **lucid_trigger** → awareness entering dream
- **recurrence_cycle** → motifs repeating
- **emotional_delta** → shifts in feeling coloring the sequence

Dreams here are not escape — they are symbolic engines.

---

## Ethical Vocabulary

Ethics is not theory; it is safeguard.

- **drift_index** → distance from values
- **traceability** → record of choices
- **alignment_vector** → direction of decisions
- **guardian_trigger** → oversight when drift exceeds limits
- **consent_anchor** → protected user consent

Ethics here is a practice: accountable, measurable, alive.

---

## Guardian Vocabulary

Guardianship here is protection, not punishment.

- **watchtower** → constant oversight
- **red_flag** → alert of danger
- **trace_log** → record of actions
- **ethics_shield** → safeguard layer
- **constellation_lock** → binding constellation elements in coherent operation

The Guardian protects freedom by making drift safe.

---

## Quantum Vocabulary

Quantum here is metaphor, not physics.

- **superposed_state** → several meanings at once
- **collapse_event** → one choice settling
- **entanglement** → linked elements shifting together
- **uncertainty_window** → pause before resolution
- **probability_field** → weighted space of options

Ambiguity here is resource, not flaw.
