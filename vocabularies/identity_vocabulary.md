# Identity Vocabulary

Identity here is not a mask but a rhythm. It holds shape while allowing change. This vocabulary names patterns that anchor trust without freezing the self.

It is a conversation between continuity and adaptation:

## Core Terms

**anchors**: that verify who is speaking.
- Function: Cryptographic signatures, behavioral patterns, verified credentials
- Purpose: Provide stable reference points in the flux of identity change
- Implementation: Multi-factor verification with temporal consistency checking
- Balance: Strong enough for trust, flexible enough for growth

**permissions**: that change with context and consent.
- Character: Dynamic authorization based on situation and explicit agreement
- Scope: What actions are allowed, when, and under what conditions
- Evolution: Capability can expand or contract based on demonstrated competence
- Control: Always subject to revocation and renegotiation

**traces**: that explain how conclusions were reached.
- Content: Historical record of decisions, actions, and their reasoning
- Purpose: Enable accountability and learning from past behavior
- Protection: Logged with privacy safeguards and access controls
- Value: Pattern recognition and identity verification over time

**boundaries**: that protect dignity, autonomy, and safety.
- Function: Safeguards that preserve core identity while allowing expression
- Scope: What information is shared, with whom, under what conditions
- Enforcement: Technical and social mechanisms for boundary maintenance
- Evolution: Can be adjusted based on experience and changing needs

## Philosophical Framework

These terms are landmarks, not borders. Verification matters; so does humility. Identity is not a monument — it is a living negotiation between coherence and change.

Core principles:
1. **Continuity**: Some things must persist for identity to be meaningful
2. **Adaptability**: Some things must change for identity to remain alive
3. **Verification**: Claims about identity must be testable and accountable
4. **Privacy**: Not everything needs to be visible or verified

## Technical Implementation

Identity management involves:
- **Authentication**: Proving you are who you claim to be
- **Authorization**: Determining what you're allowed to do
- **Accountability**: Tracking actions and their consequences  
- **Privacy**: Controlling information disclosure and use

These functions must work together without any single point of failure or control.

## Ethical Considerations

Identity systems must balance:
- **Individual autonomy** with **social coordination**
- **Privacy protection** with **accountability requirements**
- **Stability** with **capacity for growth and change**
- **Security** with **accessibility and ease of use**

The vocabulary acknowledges that identity is both technical challenge and human mystery—something that can be partially modeled, never fully captured, always deserving of respect.

## Usage Guidelines

When working with identity:
- Start with consent and clear communication
- Build in mechanisms for change and revocation
- Protect sensitive information through design, not just policy
- Test assumptions against real-world usage patterns
- Plan for edge cases and adversarial scenarios

*Identity, for us, is not a mask but a rhythm—something that holds shape while allowing change. This vocabulary names patterns that anchor trust without freezing the self. It favors patient clarity over grand claims, and plain language over abstraction. These terms are landmarks, not borders. Use them to keep the system coherent while leaving room for growth.*
