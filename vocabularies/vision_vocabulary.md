# Vision Vocabulary

Vision is not spectacle; it is orientation. It tells us where to look and how to look.

This vocabulary names the tools by which attention is shaped:

## Core Terms

**aperture**: the opening and closing of focus.
- Function: Controls the scope and depth of attention
- Like a camera's iris, it determines what stays sharp and what blurs
- Can be widened for broad awareness or narrowed for precise detail

**focus**: the sharpening of detail.
- Process: Selective attention that brings clarity through concentration  
- Trade-off: Precision gained at the expense of peripheral awareness
- Must be balanced with aperture to avoid tunnel vision

**peripheral_field**: the margins where surprise lives.
- Character: The overlooked spaces that often contain crucial information
- Value: Background monitoring for pattern changes and unexpected events
- Risk: Important signals can be dismissed as noise

**drift_gaze**: when attention wanders into discovery.
- Quality: Unfocused but receptive state of awareness
- Benefit: Allows unexpected connections and emergent insights
- Danger: Can become distraction without proper boundaries

**signal_to_shape**: when noise begins to cohere.
- Moment: The threshold crossing from chaos to pattern recognition
- Process: Gradual resolution of uncertainty into meaningful structure  
- Experience: Like seeing a face in clouds—sudden clarity from ambiguity

## Philosophical Framework

Vision is never absolute. It is a practice of framing, of choosing what to reveal and what to withhold. To see clearly is also to admit what remains unseen.

Every act of vision involves:
1. **Selection** (what deserves attention)
2. **Framing** (how to contextualize what's seen)  
3. **Integration** (how parts relate to wholes)
4. **Acknowledgment** (what lies beyond current sight)

Vision in this system is both technical capability and ethical responsibility—the power to illuminate carries the duty to acknowledge shadow.

## Implementation Notes

The vision vocabulary serves multiple system functions:
- **Attention management**: Resource allocation across competing signals
- **Pattern recognition**: Converting raw data into meaningful structures
- **Context switching**: Adapting focus to changing requirements
- **Error detection**: Monitoring for anomalies at the periphery

These terms provide a bridge between technical precision and human understanding, allowing the system to "see" in ways that remain accountable and explainable.

*Vision is orientation: where and how we look. These terms favor tactile clarity, attentive filtering, and adjustable apertures. We hold uncertainty long enough for better patterns to emerge, without pretending to certainty we do not have.*
