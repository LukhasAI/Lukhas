## Vision Vocabulary

"Vision" is not spectacle; it is orientation. It tells us where to look and how
to look, so the system can discover rather than merely confirm.

This vocabulary prefers tactile images over slogans. It treats attention as a
limited resource and clarity as a shared responsibility. Terms here describe
how signals are filtered, how meaning is surfaced, and how uncertainty is
held long enough for better patterns to emerge.

We avoid final statements. We name what we can see, note what we cannot, and
keep the aperture adjustable. Vision is a practice: align, observe, refine,
repeat—with safeguards that make discovery safe for everyone involved.

Vision Vocabulary

Vision is orientation: where and how we look. These terms favor tactile clarity,
attentive filtering, and adjustable apertures. We hold uncertainty long enough
for better patterns to emerge, without pretending to certainty we do not have.

Name what is seen. Note what is not. Keep discovery safe and inclusive.
