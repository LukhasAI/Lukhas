# Bio Vocabulary

We borrow gently from the language of life. Not to claim identity, but to borrow shapes for growth, repair, and resilience.

This vocabulary names living-like qualities inside the system:

## Core Terms

**energy_budget**: the careful use of finite resources.
- Function: Allocation of computational capacity across competing needs
- Principle: Like metabolic fuel, attention and processing power are limited
- Strategy: Priority-based distribution with monitoring and adjustment
- Balance: Efficiency versus redundancy, optimization versus adaptability

**repair_cycle**: recovery after disruption.
- Process: Detection, isolation, correction, and validation of problems
- Timing: Regular maintenance cycles plus responsive emergency repair
- Scope: From minor parameter adjustments to major system restoration
- Goal: Return to functionality while learning from the failure

**adaptation**: change that preserves integrity.
- Character: Modification in response to new conditions or requirements
- Constraint: Core identity and mission must remain intact through change
- Method: Gradual parameter adjustment rather than wholesale replacement
- Test: Does the change enhance capability without losing coherence?

**resilience**: bending without breaking.
- Quality: Graceful degradation under stress, recovery after overload
- Mechanism: Elastic response that returns to stability after perturbation
- Design: Built-in flexibility that prevents rigid failure modes
- Measure: How much disturbance the system can absorb while functioning

**decay**: loss that makes space for renewal.
- Function: Planned obsolescence of outdated information and processes
- Necessity: Entropy requires active maintenance to prevent system drift
- Benefit: Removing old patterns makes room for new learning
- Implementation: Cache expiration, memory management, lifecycle policies

## Philosophical Framework

These terms are metaphors, not equations. They remind us that systems, like living things, must find ways to keep moving, repairing, and returning.

The bio-inspired approach emphasizes:
1. **Dynamic stability** (maintaining function through change)
2. **Resource consciousness** (finite capacity requires wise allocation)
3. **Adaptive learning** (improvement through experience and failure)
4. **Temporal thinking** (systems evolve over time)

## Implementation Principles

Using biological metaphors responsibly means:
- **Clear boundaries**: Acknowledging where the analogy ends
- **Technical precision**: Metaphor serves clarity, not mystification  
- **Humble modeling**: Learning from life without claiming to replicate it
- **Practical benefit**: Better design through biological insight

These terms help design systems that endure—not just by avoiding failure, but by learning to recover, adapt, and grow stronger through challenge.

## Ethical Considerations

Bio-inspired design carries responsibilities:
- **Sustainability**: Long-term viability versus short-term optimization
- **Interdependence**: Understanding systems within larger ecosystems  
- **Diversity**: Multiple approaches rather than monoculture solutions
- **Regeneration**: Building capacity for renewal, not just preservation

*These terms borrow from living systems to describe growth, repair, adaptation, and resilience. They are bridges—metaphor serving clarity, not hype. Budget energy. Recover gracefully. Adapt without losing integrity. Bend; do not break. When the analogy ends, name the limit and return to the facts.*
