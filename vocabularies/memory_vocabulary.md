# Memory Vocabulary

Memory is not a vault but a field. It stores, but it also reshapes.

This vocabulary gives names to the ways memory behaves inside the system:

## Core Terms

**folds**: layers of recall, reopened and compressed.
- Structure: Hierarchical organization where related memories cluster together
- Process: Information is compressed during storage, reconstructed during recall
- Benefit: Efficient storage with context-sensitive retrieval
- Risk: Compression can introduce distortions or lose fine detail

**echoes**: fragments that return and color the present.
- Character: Recurring patterns or symbols that persist across different sessions
- Function: Motifs that influence current processing based on past experience
- Recognition: May appear in unexpected contexts, triggering associations
- Value: Provide continuity and pattern recognition across time

**drift**: the slow change of what was stored.
- Nature: Gradual modification of memories through use and time
- Mechanism: Each recall potentially alters the original trace
- Effect: Old information may become less accurate but more meaningful
- Acceptance: Normal process, not necessarily a bug or failure

**anchors**: points of verification, where fact is confirmed.
- Purpose: Ground truth references that resist drift and provide stability
- Implementation: Checksums, timestamps, external validation sources
- Usage: Critical information that must maintain accuracy over time
- Limitation: Cannot anchor everything—selection requires judgment

**erosion**: the fading of access, natural or chosen.
- Natural: Gradual loss due to entropy, interference, or lack of use
- Deliberate: Privacy-preserving forgetting, strategic amnesia
- Necessity: Finite storage requires decisions about what to keep
- Benefit: Old patterns fade to make room for new learning

## Philosophical Framework

Memory is never final. Forgetting is as real as recall, and both are part of how the system stays alive. What we keep matters; so does what we release.

Key insights:
1. **Memory is reconstructive**: Each recall rebuilds rather than replays
2. **Forgetting is functional**: Necessary for learning and adaptation
3. **Context shapes recall**: Same information accessed differently in different situations
4. **Time transforms meaning**: Memories gain significance through reflection

## Technical Architecture

Memory systems must handle:
- **Encoding**: How experience becomes stored information
- **Storage**: Distributed, compressed, with appropriate redundancy  
- **Retrieval**: Context-sensitive reconstruction of stored patterns
- **Modification**: Updating and refining memories through use
- **Deletion**: Planned obsolescence and privacy-respecting erasure

## Ethical Considerations

Memory management involves moral choices:
- **Individual privacy** versus **collective memory**  
- **Accuracy** versus **meaning** (sometimes stories matter more than facts)
- **Preservation** versus **forgetting** (what deserves to be kept?)
- **Access control**: Who can see what, when, and why?

## Usage Patterns

Effective memory systems:
- Balance permanence with adaptability
- Provide multiple retrieval pathways  
- Acknowledge uncertainty and gaps
- Support both precise recall and fuzzy pattern matching
- Enable graceful degradation when information is incomplete

The vocabulary treats memory as a living process—not storage but ongoing relationship between past, present, and possibility.
