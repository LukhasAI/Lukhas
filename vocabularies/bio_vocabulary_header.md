## Bio Vocabulary

We borrow gently from the language of life. Not to claim a one-to-one mapping,
but to speak about systems that grow, repair, and adapt. These terms serve as
bridges between mechanism and metabolism—always metaphor in service of clarity.

Our focus:
- **Energy** as attention and compute, budgeted with care.
- **Repair** as graceful recovery after stress or drift.
- **Adaptation** as change that preserves integrity.
- **Resilience** as the capacity to bend without breaking.

Use this vocabulary to model living-like behavior responsibly. Keep metaphors
grounded. Do not overreach. Where the analogy ends, say so, and return to the
facts. Integrity first, imagery second, and learning throughout.

Bio Vocabulary

These terms borrow from living systems to describe growth, repair, adaptation,
and resilience. They are bridges—metaphor serving clarity, not hype.

Budget energy. Recover gracefully. Adapt without losing integrity. Bend;
do not break. When the analogy ends, name the limit and return to the facts.
