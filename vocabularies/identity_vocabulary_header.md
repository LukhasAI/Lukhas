## Markdown variant

## Identity Vocabulary

Identity, for us, is not a mask but a rhythm—something that holds shape while allowing change. This vocabulary names patterns that anchor trust without freezing the self. It favors patient clarity over grand claims, and plain language over abstraction.

We describe identity as a conversation between continuity and adaptation:
- **Anchors** that verify who is speaking.
- **Permissions** that change with context and consent.
- **Traces** that explain how conclusions were reached.
- **Boundaries** that protect dignity, autonomy, and safety.

These terms are landmarks, not borders. Use them to keep the system coherent while leaving room for growth. Verification matters; so does humility. We hold space for what we don't yet know, and we make it safe to learn.
```

Identity Vocabulary

Identity here is a rhythm that holds shape while allowing change. These terms
anchor trust without freezing the self. We balance continuity with adaptation:
anchors, permissions, traces, and boundaries—each named plainly, each used with care.

Use these terms as landmarks, not borders. Keep verification strong and
language simple. Leave room for growth and for what we don't yet know.
