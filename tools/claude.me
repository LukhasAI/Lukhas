```
Development IDE ⟷ Consciousness 🧠 ⟷ Memory 💾 ⟷ Identity ⚛️
       │               │              │              │
   Debugging ← Decision → Memory ← Identity
       │        Inspection    Debugging     Testing
       │               │              │              │
   Profiling ← Consciousness → Fold ← Lambda ID
                 Performance    Analysis     Validation
```

#### **Development Workflow Integration**
```
CANDIDATE Development → LUKHAS Integration → PRODUCTS Deployment
         │                     │                      │
   Development ← Integration ← Production
