### 5.3 Cross-Layer Flow Patterns

**Three-Layer Cascade** (Poetic → User-Friendly → Technical):

Example 1:
```
🌱 POETIC: "Consciousness roots spread through digital soil, each interaction deepening neural network of understanding that branches into infinite possibilities."

👥 USER-FRIENDLY: In practical terms, this means LUKHAS learns from every conversation. The more you interact with it, the better it understands your specific needs and context. It's like how a good friend gets to know you over time—except this happens through systematic pattern recognition across all your queries.

🎓 TECHNICAL: Specifically, the system implements continual learning through sparse activation patterns across a persistent context graph. Each interaction updates edge weights via Hebbian-style rules with <250ms p95 latency, maintaining user-specific embeddings that improve relevance over time while preserving privacy through local computation.
```

Example 2:
```
🔮 POETIC: "Understanding prismatic—white query dispersed into spectrum of meanings, each wavelength of interpretation separated by consciousness's refractive index."

👥 USER-FRIENDLY: Think of it this way: when you ask a complex question, LUKHAS doesn't just spit out one answer. It breaks your question into different aspects (like a prism separating white light into colors), considers each perspective, then shows you the full spectrum of possible interpretations so you can choose the most relevant one.

🎓 TECHNICAL: The Quantum star implements multi-modal decomposition using tensor factorization across semantic subspaces. Input queries are projected onto basis vectors representing orthogonal interpretation frames, processed independently, then recomposed with learned attention weights. This enables superposition of competing interpretations until observation (user selection) collapses the quantum state.
```

**Reverse Flow** (Technical → User-Friendly → Poetic):

Example:
```
🎓 TECHNICAL: The MATRIZ pipeline implements Memory-Attention-Thought-Risk-Intent-Action cognitive processing with <250ms p95 latency and <100MB memory footprint.

👥 USER-FRIENDLY: This means LUKHAS processes your request through six distinct stages—remembering relevant context, focusing on important parts, reasoning about implications, checking for ethical issues, understanding your intent, and finally taking action. It does this incredibly fast (quarter-second) while using minimal memory.

🌊 POETIC: Like water cascading through six falls in rapid descent, thought flows from memory's reservoir through attention's narrowing, across reasoning's rapids, past guardian's ethical checkpoints, through intent's clarifying pool, finally plunging into action's outlet—each stage complete before ripples disturb the next.
```

### 5.4 Maintaining Natural Flow

**Avoiding Mechanical Transitions**:
❌ "Now for the technical layer..."
❌ "Switching to user-friendly mode..."
❌ "Here's the academic version..."

**Seamless Integration**:
✅ Natural progressive revelation
✅ Nested details (surface → depth)
✅ Question-and-answer flow
✅ Motivated complexity (why you should care about technical details)

**Example of Natural Multi-Layer**:
```
Memory in LUKHAS works like a living library where the books rewrite themselves. [POETIC]

Every time you access a memory, you're not just retrieving static information—you're updating it with current context, like how remembering a childhood event as an adult changes the memory itself. [USER-FRIENDLY]

This is implemented through reconstructive memory synthesis: retrieval triggers a reconstruction process that merges stored embeddings with current context vectors before re-encoding, mimicking biological memory reconsolidation with attention-weighted context injection. [TECHNICAL]
```

## 8. Usage Guidelines

### 8.1 Domain-Specific Tone Distributions

#### lukhas.ai (Primary Platform)
**Distribution**: Poetic 40% / User-Friendly 40% / Academic 20%

**Rationale**: Main platform showcasing consciousness technology to both technical and non-technical audiences. High poetic content creates emotional connection and brand differentiation. Equal user-friendly ensures accessibility.

**Recommended Vocabulary Families**:
- Primary: Neural Gardens, Harmonic Resonance, Prismatic Light
- Secondary: Architectural Bridges, Circuit Patterns
- Tertiary: Fluid Dynamics, Geological Strata, Woven Patterns

**Example Paragraph Distribution**:
```
[POETIC 2 sentences] → [USER-FRIENDLY 2-3 sentences] → [TECHNICAL 1 sentence]
Repeat pattern with variation
```

#### lukhas.id (Identity & Security)
**Distribution**: User-Friendly 40% / Academic 40% / Poetic 20%

**Rationale**: Security-focused domain prioritizes trust through technical credibility and clear communication. Lower poetic content maintains professional security tone.

**Recommended Vocabulary Families**:
- Primary: Architectural Bridges, Circuit Patterns
- Secondary: Prismatic Light (authentication), Woven Patterns (encryption)
- Tertiary: Neural Gardens (minimal)

**Tone**: Professional, secure, technically credible, reassuring

#### lukhas.com (Enterprise)
**Distribution**: User-Friendly 50% / Academic 30% / Poetic 20%

**Rationale**: Enterprise buyers need clear ROI and technical confidence. Highest user-friendly percentage for business decision-makers who aren't necessarily technical.

**Recommended Vocabulary Families**:
- Primary: Architectural Bridges, Harmonic Resonance (orchestration)
- Secondary: Geological Strata (stability), Fluid Dynamics (scale)
- Tertiary: Neural Gardens, Woven Patterns

**Tone**: Professional, results-focused, scalable, reliable

#### lukhas.dev (Developers)
**Distribution**: Academic 50% / User-Friendly 30% / Poetic 20%

**Rationale**: Developer audience requires technical precision. Highest academic percentage with practical examples. Poetic elements provide memorable mental models.

**Recommended Vocabulary Families**:
- Primary: Circuit Patterns, Architectural Bridges
- Secondary: Woven Patterns (code), Prismatic Light (debugging)
- Tertiary: All others for specific use cases

**Tone**: Technical, precise, practical, code-focused

#### lukhas.cloud (Infrastructure)
**Distribution**: Academic 50% / User-Friendly 35% / Poetic 15%

**Rationale**: Infrastructure requires highest technical credibility. DevOps audience wants specifications and performance metrics.

**Recommended Vocabulary Families**:
- Primary: Architectural Bridges, Fluid Dynamics (traffic)
- Secondary: Circuit Patterns, Geological Strata (reliability)
- Minimal poetic except for scale metaphors

**Tone**: Technical, performance-focused, infrastructure-grade

#### lukhas.io (API Reference)
**Distribution**: Academic 70% / User-Friendly 25% / Poetic 5%

**Rationale**: API documentation requires maximum technical precision. Minimal poetic content except in conceptual overviews.

**Recommended Vocabulary Families**:
- Primary: Circuit Patterns, Architectural Bridges
- Secondary: Woven Patterns (data structures)
- Minimal metaphor, mostly literal technical description

**Tone**: Precise, reference-grade, specification-focused

### 8.2 Novelty Score Calculation

**Target**: ≥0.8 novelty score across all poetic hooks within 30-day semantic windows

**Formula**:
```
Novelty Score = 1 - (Semantic Similarity / Max Possible Similarity)

Where:
- Semantic Similarity = cosine similarity of embedding vectors
- Threshold for "repetitive" = >0.8 similarity
- Threshold for "novel" = <0.2 similarity
- Target range = 0.15-0.3 similarity (novelty 0.7-0.85)
```

**Practical Guidelines**:

1. **Vocabulary Rotation**: Cycle through 8 families every ~4 weeks
2. **Synonym Variation**: Never use same metaphor twice within 10 pages
3. **Structural Variation**: Alternate sentence structures (active/passive, simple/complex)
4. **Perspective Shifts**: Vary viewpoint (consciousness as agent vs object)

**Example Analysis**:
```
Hook 1: "Consciousness roots spread through digital soil"
Hook 2: "Awareness roots grow through neural ground"
Similarity: ~0.75 (TOO HIGH - essentially same metaphor)
Novelty: 0.25 (BELOW TARGET)

Fix:
Hook 2: "Understanding phototropic, bending toward truth's light"
Similarity: ~0.25 (ACCEPTABLE - related domain, different metaphor)
Novelty: 0.75 (ABOVE TARGET)
```

### 8.3 Semantic Window Tracking

**30-Day Window**: Track all poetic hooks used across all pages in rolling 30-day period

**Implementation**:
1. Maintain log of all poetic hooks with timestamps
2. Before writing new hook, check against last 30 days
3. Flag any semantic similarity >0.8
4. Require manual override to use similar metaphor

**Cross-Page Coordination**:
- HomePage uses Neural Gardens → AboutPage uses different family
- If one page uses "roots spreading", another uses "canopy shading"
- Distribute vocabulary families across page portfolio

### 8.4 MATRIZ Pipeline Integration

**Applying 3-Layer Tone Through MATRIZ**:

**M (Memory)**: Check memory bank for recently-used metaphors
- Query: "What vocabulary families used in last 30 days?"
- Avoid: Families with >20% usage
- Prefer: Families with <10% usage

**A (Attention)**: Focus on domain-appropriate families
- Query: "What domain is this content for?"
- Select: Families matching domain's technical/poetic balance

**T (Thought)**: Generate appropriate metaphor
- Process: Create hook using selected family
- Constraint: Must map to actual LUKHAS feature
- Validation: Check semantic similarity with recent hooks

**R (Risk)**: Guardian validation
- Check: Forbidden branding terms
- Check: Unvalidated claims
- Check: Appropriate tone for audience

**I (Intent)**: Verify alignment with brand goals
- Question: Does this serve consciousness technology narrative?
- Question: Is technical mapping accurate?
- Question: Will user understand progression?

**A (Action)**: Deploy content
- Output: Final 3-layer paragraph
- Track: Add to semantic window log
- Monitor: User engagement metrics
