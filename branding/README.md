- ⚛️ **Identity**: Authenticity and consciousness
- 🧠 **Consciousness**: Memory, learning, awareness  
- 🛡️ **Guardian**: Ethics and protection

### 3. Human-Centric Language
- Technology serves consciousness, not computation
- Emphasize understanding over processing
- Focus on consciousness over algorithms
