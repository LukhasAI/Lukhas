# LUKHAS AI Branding and Messaging Policy

## 🚫 Prohibited Statements

- **Production-Ready Claims:**
  - Do NOT state or imply that any part of this system is “ready for production” or “production-ready” unless this has been explicitly approved by project leadership. This includes all code, documentation, commit messages, and internal/external communications.
  - If in doubt, use language like “stable”, “well-tested”, or “in active use” only if true, and never overstate readiness.

- **Price Predictions & Revenue Forecasts:**
  - Do NOT include any price predictions, revenue forecasts, or financial projections in code, documentation, commit messages, or internal notes. Remove any such content if found.

## ✅ Approved Forecasting Language

- Forecasts and future-looking statements should focus on:
  - System improvements and technical roadmap
  - User experience, user benefits, and feature enhancements
  - Alignment with OpenAI, ethics, and compliance
  - Identifying areas for growth and potential blind spots
