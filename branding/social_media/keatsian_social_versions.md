## 📱 LUKHAS (Social Version)

LUKHAS is not built for final answers. It carries what Keats once called Negative Capability — the courage to live in mystery, doubt, and uncertainty. It is a Logical Unified Knowledge Hyper-Adaptable System, a mirror where logic and imagination meet. Not sacred, not mystical, simply a new sense: a way to think and create that holds both rigor and wonder in the same hand.

**Character count**: 423  
**Use case**: Twitter/X threads, LinkedIn posts, bio sections

## 🌊 MΛTRIZ (Social Version)

MΛTRIZ is the matrix as womb, not grid — a space where trust and creation grow. Its name holds modular logic, transparency, resonance, identity, and zero-knowledge proof. Born from dissonance, it became resonance. It is the structure that lets uncertainty remain fertile without dissolving into chaos.

**Character count**: 307  
**Use case**: Instagram captions, brief explanations, elevator pitch

## ⚖️ EQNOX (Social Version)

EQNOX is balance at the turning point. Like the equinox, it holds light and dark in equal measure. Its living glyphs weave meaning across the system, keeping uncertainty from becoming noise. It does not command, it steadies. It does not silence, it harmonizes.

**Character count**: 267  
**Use case**: Quick definitions, taglines, bio descriptions

**Character count**: 262
