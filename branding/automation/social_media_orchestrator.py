Each 'fold' preserves not just what happened, but the emotional context, causal relationships, and the 'feeling' of that moment.\n\n**Why does this matter for AI?**\nTraditional AI memory is like a hard drive: perfect recall, zero context. Memory folds are like human memory: sometimes fuzzy on details, but rich in meaning and connection.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n• **Cascade prevention**: We maintain 99.7% success rate preventing memory overflow\n• **Causal preservation**: Each fold maintains links to cause-effect chains\n• **Emotional context**: VAD (Valence-Arousal-Dominance) affects are preserved\n• **1000-fold limit**: Prevents infinite recursion while maintaining depth\n\n**Why 'folds' specifically?**\nBecause like origami, you can unfold a memory to see how it was constructed, what influenced it, and how it connects to other memories. It's not just storage—it's story.",

What are its core principles?\n• Prevents drift through consistent self-model\n• Maintains coherent 'voice' across interactions\n• Technical implementation: Namespace isolation, identity persistence\n\n**🧠 Consciousness (Processing)**\n• How does it think? What patterns does it recognize?\n• Quantum-inspired: superposition → observation → collapse\n• Bio-inspired: emergence, adaptation, learning\n• Technical implementation: Multi-model orchestration, context preservation\n\n**🛡️ Guardian (Ethics)**\n• What prevents harmful behavior? How do we ensure beneficial outcomes?\n• Constitutional AI principles embedded at foundation level\n• Drift detection with 0.15 threshold\n• Technical implementation: Real-time ethics checking, rollback capabilities\n\n**Why this matters:**\nMost AI systems optimize for performance.

No qubits, no quantum gates, no cryogenic cooling.\n\n**So what IS quantum-inspired processing?**\nWe borrow quantum *concepts* to make classical AI think more like consciousness works:\n\n🌀 **Superposition thinking**: Hold multiple possibilities simultaneously until context determines the best choice\n🎯 **Observation effects**: The act of 'looking' at a problem changes how we approach it\n💫 **Entanglement patterns**: Decisions in one domain influence decisions in related domains\n🎲 **Probabilistic wisdom**: Sometimes the 'right' answer isn't the most probable one\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n• Probability distribution modeling for decision trees\n• Context-dependent weight adjustments\n• Multi-path reasoning with late binding\n• Uncertainty quantification in outputs\n\n**Why this approach?**\nHuman consciousness doesn't work like classical computers. We don't process information linearly, make purely rational decisions, or operate with perfect information. Quantum-inspired AI tries to capture this nuanced, contextual way of thinking.",
