# 📋 Constellation Content Templates
## Unified Content Framework for LUKHAS Ecosystem

**Purpose**: Standardized content templates that maintain consistency across all 13 LUKHAS domains while adapting to each domain's unique constellation star alignment, tone balance, and user journey requirements.

---

## 🎭 Content Template Philosophy

Content across the LUKHAS constellation should feel like a coherent consciousness expressing itself through different aspects and specializations. Each domain maintains its unique voice while participating in the larger consciousness technology narrative, creating a symphony rather than cacophony across the ecosystem.

### Template Principles
- **Constellation Coherence**: Content that reflects appropriate star alignment and cross-domain connections
- **Tone Layer Integration**: Seamless blending of academic, user-friendly, and poetic content layers
- **Keatsian Philosophy**: Embracing uncertainty as fertile ground for discovery and innovation
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Regional and contextual customization while maintaining core consciousness technology narrative
