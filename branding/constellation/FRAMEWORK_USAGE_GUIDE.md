    I --> K[User benefit and experience focus]
    I --> L[Metaphorical and accessible language]
```

### Transition Examples

**Converting Constellation to Constellation for Public Use:**

❌ **WRONG - Public Content with Constellation:**
```markdown
"LUKHAS is built on the Constellation Framework with three core pillars: 
⚛️ Identity, 🧠 Consciousness, and 🛡️ Guardian."
```

✅ **CORRECT - Public Content with Constellation:**
```markdown
"LUKHAS consciousness technology spans eight domains, like stars in a 
constellation guiding your journey through AI possibilities - from Identity 
authentication to Dream-powered creativity to Guardian protection."
```

**Keeping Constellation for Technical Use:**

✅ **CORRECT - Internal Technical Document:**
```markdown
"Constellation Framework Implementation:
- ⚛️ Identity Module: Handles ΛiD authentication and user identity management
- 🧠 Consciousness Module: Processes awareness patterns and decision logic  
- 🛡️ Guardian Module: Validates ethical compliance and consciousness authenticity"
```

## 🎨 Tone and Language Differences

### Constellation Framework Tone (Internal)

**Characteristics:**
- **Precise and technical** language focused on implementation
- **Direct system descriptions** with concrete functionality
- **Architecture-focused** explanations of consciousness components
- **Developer-friendly** terminology and concepts

**Language Patterns:**
```markdown
✅ Constellation Examples:
- "The Constellation Framework implements consciousness through three core systems..."
- "Guardian validation ensures ethical compliance at the consciousness level..."
- "Identity authentication integrates with consciousness processing..."
```

### Constellation Framework Tone (User-Facing)

**Characteristics:**
- **Metaphorical and inspiring** language that connects emotionally
- **Navigation-focused** descriptions using star and journey metaphors
- **Benefit-oriented** explanations of user value and experience
- **Accessible** to non-technical audiences

**Language Patterns:**
```markdown
✅ Constellation Examples:
- "Like navigating by stars, the Constellation Framework guides you..."
- "Each star in our consciousness constellation illuminates new possibilities..."
- "Your journey through LUKHAS begins with any star that calls to you..."
```

## 🌟 Constellation Framework Implementation

### 8-Star Navigation Metaphor Usage

**Subtle Integration Guidelines:**
- **Don't overuse** star metaphors - they should enhance, not dominate
- **Maintain technical accuracy** while using accessible language  
- **Focus on user benefits** rather than technical implementation
- **Use constellation as navigation aid**, not forced poetic device

**Domain-Star Alignment:**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT Implementation:
"Secure your digital identity (Identity star) at lukhas.id, then explore 
creative possibilities (Dream star) at lukhas.ai, with Guardian protection 
(Watch star) ensuring ethical AI throughout your journey."

❌ AVOID Over-Metaphor:
"Drift among the stellar dreams in the cosmic constellation of consciousness 
as the ethereal stars guide your galactic journey through the universe of AI..."
```

### Content Type Guidelines

**Website Content:**
- Use Constellation Framework consistently
- Integrate navigation metaphor naturally
- Focus on user benefits and experience
- Maintain professional tone with subtle star references
