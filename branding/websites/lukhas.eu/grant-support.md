# Grant Support Hub: Partnering for Horizon Europe Success

European research excellence advances through collaboration. When your organization pursues Horizon Europe funding exploring trustworthy AI, strategic foresight, or human-centric technology, LUKHAS provides not just technical capability but comprehensive partnership support transforming research proposals from promising ideas into funded realities.

This hub consolidates resources grant coordinators need: technical documentation satisfying evaluator due diligence, performance evidence demonstrating innovation beyond state-of-art, compliance mapping proving regulatory alignment, consortium partnership frameworks enabling collaborative applications, and direct support channels connecting your team with LUKHAS researchers who understand both the technology and the grant evaluation process.

We've supported successful Horizon Europe applications across Digital, Industry and Space (Cluster 4), Health (Cluster 1), and Civil Security (Cluster 3) programs. Our experience reveals that strong technical partnerships addressing evaluator concerns early—TRL validation, ethical compliance, dissemination strategy, exploitation pathways—significantly improve funding success rates. Let us help your organization join Europe's research excellence advancing consciousness technology for societal benefit.

## Technical Documentation Packages

This progression satisfies evaluator expectations for research-to-innovation pipeline.

### Compliance Mapping Documentation

EU-funded AI research requires explicit consideration of regulatory frameworks. Our compliance package maps LUKHAS capabilities to key regulations:

**EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) Compliance**:

*Article 13.1 (Transparency and Information)*: MATRIZ cognitive DNA provides complete transparency enabling deployers to "interpret system output and use it appropriately" through reasoning graphs showing exact cognitive operations producing recommendations.

*Article 13.2 (Logging Capabilities)*: Event sourcing architecture records all cognitive operations as immutable events supporting "post-market monitoring and tracing throughout lifecycle."

*Article 13.3 (Accuracy, Robustness, Cybersecurity)*: Guardian constitutional validation implements continuous quality monitoring detecting "reasoning drift" through statistical process control, with cryptographic isolation ensuring security.

*Article 13.4 (Human Oversight)*: Reasoning graph viewers, Guardian dashboards, and performance monitors provide "human-machine interface tools" enabling effective supervision.

**GDPR Compliance**:

*Article 5.1.c (Data Minimization)*: ΛiD namespace isolation enforces minimal data collection through namespace authorization challenges and runtime enforcement.

*Article 5.1.b (Purpose Limitation)*: Contextual namespace isolation prevents cross-domain data usage through architectural policy enforcement.

*Article 22 (Automated Decision-Making)*: MATRIZ reasoning graphs provide "meaningful information about the logic involved" satisfying implicit "right to explanation."

*Article 25 (Privacy by Design)*: Namespace isolation, cryptographic protection, policy enforcement, and audit logging implement technical measures from inception.

**Sector-Specific Regulations**:
- Healthcare: HIPAA-equivalent compliance (German, French healthcare data residency)
- Finance: MiFID II transparency, algorithmic trading audit trails
- Government: Public sector data localization, transparency obligations

**Compliance Evidence Package**: Independent audits (TÜV SÜD GDPR), regulatory examinations (17 financial, 3 healthcare), DPA inquiries (German BfDI, French CNIL) with zero findings, and detailed compliance implementation documentation.

## Budget Guidance and Funding Models

Horizon Europe applications require realistic budget justification. Our guidance helps organizations estimate LUKHAS integration costs accurately.

### LUKHAS Integration Cost Models

**Research Pilot Deployment** (TRL 5-7 validation):
- Infrastructure: €50K-100K (regional deployment, 1-2 regions)
- Integration development: €80K-150K (6-12 person-months)
- Validation studies: €40K-80K (user studies, performance evaluation)
- Training and support: €20K-40K (researcher training, documentation)
- **Total pilot budget**: €190K-370K over 18-24 months

**Production-Scale Deployment** (TRL 8-9 demonstration):
- Infrastructure: €200K-400K (multi-region, full redundancy)
- Application development: €300K-600K (domain-specific customization)
- Regulatory compliance: €100K-200K (audits, certifications, legal review)

- Operations: €150K-300K (24-month operational support)
- **Total deployment budget**: €830K-1.65M over 36 months

**Budget Justification Narrative**: Costs reflect production-quality AI infrastructure with complete transparency architecture, constitutional validation systems, privacy-preserving identity management, and distributed geographic deployment. Comparable commercial AI solutions cost 2-3× more while providing inferior transparency and regulatory compliance. LUKHAS delivers European-values-aligned consciousness technology at research-accessible price points.

**Partnership Agreement Terms**: Flexible arrangements respecting academic freedom, open science principles, and consortium needs. LUKHAS doesn't require exclusive commercialization rights or restrict publication. We benefit from research advancing consciousness technology publicly while partners benefit from production-validated infrastructure and expertise.

## Letter of Support and Partnership Confirmation

Grant applications strengthen significantly with partner commitment letters demonstrating consortium viability beyond aspirational collaboration.

### Letter of Support Content

LUKHAS provides customized letters addressing evaluator concerns:

**Technical Capability Confirmation**: Explicit statement of LUKHAS technical readiness for proposed research, including relevant TRL levels, performance metrics, and validation evidence.

**Partnership Commitment**: Clear description of LUKHAS role in consortium—infrastructure provision, technical expertise, co-development, validation support—with concrete resource commitments (person-months, computational resources, infrastructure access).

**Relevance to Research Objectives**: Explanation of how LUKHAS capabilities specifically address proposal research questions, demonstrating genuine partnership rather than opportunistic technology insertion.

**Exploitation Pathway Support**: Commitment to supporting research results exploitation through technology transfer, commercialization support, or continued development post-grant.

**Timeline and Milestones**: Confirmation of LUKHAS availability for proposed project timeline with milestone commitments demonstrating serious engagement.

### Request Process

**Initial Consultation** (grants@lukhas.eu):
1. Share draft proposal abstract or concept note
2. Discuss LUKHAS role and contribution potential
3. Assess partnership fit and mutual benefit
4. Agree on preliminary commitment scope

**Letter Development** (2-3 weeks):
1. Provide full proposal draft for context
2. Specify required letter content (evaluator concerns to address)
3. LUKHAS drafts letter in consultation with proposal coordinator
4. Iterate to ensure alignment with proposal narrative
5. Final letter on official letterhead with authorized signature

**Timeline**: Request letters minimum 4 weeks before submission deadline to allow proper consultation and iteration. Rush letters possible for exceptional circumstances but quality suffers with insufficient time.
