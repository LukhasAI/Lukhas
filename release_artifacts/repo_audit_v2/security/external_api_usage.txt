# Notes:
# - Many of these are orchestration and adapter areas. The audit should ensure calls to external LLMs are wrapped by a single adapter layer, and that prompt logging is limited to hashes only.
# - Next agent task: for each path above, produce a short snippet indicating whether raw `openai.*` calls are present (if so, mark for adapter).
