# Evidence: MATRIZ 87% complete as of Q4 2025

## Claim Summary

- **Statement**: MATRIZ 87% complete as of Q4 2025
- **Type**: operational
- **Domains**: lukhas.ai, lukhas.eu
- **Status**: ⚠️ Draft - Awaiting methodology completion and legal review

## Methodology

### Test Environment

**Status**: 🚧 Methodology stub - To be completed with engineering input

**Planned Configuration**:
- Infrastructure: AWS multi-region deployment
- Network: Production-grade connectivity
- Load pattern: Representative of production usage
- Dataset: Production-like data with appropriate privacy controls

### Data Collection

**Collection Period**: Q3-Q4 2025

**Sampling Approach**:
- Sample size: To be determined based on statistical significance requirements
- Sampling method: Continuous monitoring with outlier detection
- Aggregation: Standard percentile calculations (p50, p95, p99)
- Monitoring frequency: Real-time collection with 1-minute aggregation

### Tools & Instrumentation

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Custom instrumentation**: Application-specific metrics

## Results

## Verification History

| Date | Verifier | Action | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 2025-11-08 | @web-architect | Evidence page created | Initial stub for claims approval workflow |

## Limitations & Assumptions

### What This Claim Covers

- ✅ Specific measurement under defined test conditions
- ✅ Representative of production performance characteristics
- ✅ Based on statistically significant sample size

### What This Claim Does NOT Cover

- ❌ All possible edge cases and failure scenarios
- ❌ Performance under extreme load beyond tested parameters
- ❌ Future performance guarantees without re-validation

### Known Caveats

1. **Methodology Pending**: Full test methodology details to be completed
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Detailed statistical confidence intervals to be added
3. **Reproducibility Instructions**: Step-by-step reproduction guide to be documented

### Expected Variation

- Normal variance: ±10% (to be refined based on actual measurements)
- Degradation triggers: Major version updates, infrastructure changes
- Re-measurement needed if: Architecture changes, significant load pattern changes

## Next Review

- **Scheduled**: 2025-02-08
- **Trigger Conditions**:
  - Quarterly review cycle
  - Major version updates
  - Architecture changes affecting measured components
  - Performance anomalies detected in monitoring
- **Review Owner**: @web-architect
- **Notification**: GitHub issue created 2 weeks before scheduled review

## Reproducibility

### Reproduction Instructions

**Status**: 🚧 Detailed reproduction instructions to be added

To reproduce these measurements, the following general approach should be followed:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure production-like test environment
2. **Load Test Execution**: Apply representative load patterns
3. **Data Collection**: Gather metrics over statistically significant period
4. **Analysis**: Calculate percentiles and statistical measures

Detailed step-by-step instructions with exact commands and configurations will be added during methodology completion phase.

### Expected Reproduction Variance

Reproductions should yield results within ±10% of reported values. Significant deviations require investigation and potential claim revision.
