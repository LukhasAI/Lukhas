feat(manifests): Manifest Coverage Phase 1 (core+matriz) — 100% coverage achieved

Problem
- Production lanes (core + MATRIZ) lacked consistent module.manifest.json coverage, blocking auditing and Constellation mapping.

Solution
- Generated 71 new manifests across 3 batches using a deterministic generator with lane/tier mapping and star heuristics.
- Added tools/manifests/generate_manifests.py and tools/validate_manifest.py (schema-lite) for reproducible generation + validation.
- Authored docs/audits/MANIFEST_COVERAGE_P1_REPORT.md with counts, lane breakdown, and star distribution.

Impact
- Core + MATRIZ lanes now have 100% manifest coverage in this repository.
- Enables downstream auditing, searchability, and Constellation Framework reporting.

Batch SHAs
- Batch 1: 1826fb30c43b165eda14c9ea0d1657d94a2f3880
- Batch 2: d9b5e47fe2fef4a56a1d39e4931e53ee299f5878
- Batch 3: 1a2d64245a9df60604a518b02e541461532d26a7
- Report Augment: 2025-10-26

Verification
- Validator run on newly created manifests: PASS (all).
- Orphan recomputation: 0 remaining for core+MATRIZ after path normalization.
- See report: docs/audits/MANIFEST_COVERAGE_P1_REPORT.md

Follow-ups
- Optional: Populate dependencies arrays from import analysis.
- Optional: Extend schema validation to legacy manifests via compatibility mode.
