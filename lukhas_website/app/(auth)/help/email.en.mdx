<div data-tone="plain">
  Email delivery can sometimes be delayed or blocked by various factors. This guide will help you locate your verification code and resolve common email delivery issues.
</div>

## Quick Checklist

<div data-tone="plain">
  Before diving into detailed troubleshooting, try these quick steps:

  1. **Wait 5 minutes** - Email delivery can take time
  2. **Check your spam folder** - Look for emails from `lukhas.ai`
  3. **Search your inbox** for "LUKHAS" or "verification"
  4. **Check email filters** - Corporate or personal rules might redirect emails
</div>

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### 1. Wait for Email Delivery

<div data-tone="plain">
  Email systems can experience delays, especially during high-traffic periods. Messages typically arrive within 1-2 minutes but can take up to 5 minutes under certain conditions.
</div>

<div data-tone="technical">
  **Technical Details:**
  - SMTP processing time: 30-120 seconds
  - DNS propagation delays: 1-5 minutes
  - ISP queue processing: 2-5 minutes
  - Corporate email gateway delays: 1-10 minutes
</div>

### 2. Check Your Spam/Junk Folder

<div data-tone="plain">
  Automated verification emails are sometimes classified as spam by email providers. This is especially common with:

  - New email addresses
  - Corporate email systems
  - Aggressive spam filters
</div>

**What to look for:**
- Sender: `verify@lukhas.ai`
- Subject line containing: "LUKHAS" or "Verification"
- Recent timestamp (codes expire after 15 minutes)

<div data-tone="poetic">
  Like hidden treasures waiting to be discovered, your verification code may rest quietly in the overlooked corners of your digital realm.
</div>

### 3. Search Your Inbox

<div data-tone="plain">
  Use your email client's search function to locate the message:

  **Search terms to try:**
  - `LUKHAS`
  - `lukhas.ai`
  - `verification code`
  - `verify@lukhas.ai`
</div>

<div data-tone="technical">
  **Advanced search operators (Gmail):**
  - `from:lukhas.ai`
  - `subject:verification`
  - `newer_than:1h`
  - `has:attachment` (if applicable)
</div>

### 4. Review Email Filters and Rules

<div data-tone="plain">
  Personal and corporate email filters can automatically sort or redirect messages. Check:

  - **Personal filters** - Rules you've created
  - **Corporate policies** - IT department restrictions
  - **Automatic sorting** - Priority inbox, categories, folders
  - **Third-party apps** - Email management tools
</div>

### 5. Corporate Email Considerations

<div data-tone="plain">
  Many organizations have strict email security policies that may block or delay verification emails:

  **Common corporate restrictions:**
  - External authentication emails blocked
  - New sender domains quarantined
  - Automated messages filtered
  - Link scanning delays
</div>

**Solutions for corporate email:**
- Contact your IT administrator
- Request whitelisting of `lukhas.ai` domain
- Try using a personal email address
- Use alternative authentication methods

<div data-tone="technical">
  **IT Administrator Information:**
  - Sender domain: `lukhas.ai`
  - Sender IP ranges: `203.0.113.0/24`
  - SPF record: `v=spf1 include:lukhas.ai ~all`
  - DKIM selector: `lukhas._domainkey.lukhas.ai`
</div>

### 6. Request a New Code

<div data-tone="plain">
  Verification codes expire after 15 minutes for security reasons. If you can't locate your original code, you can request a new one:

  1. Click the "Resend Code" button
  2. Wait for the cooldown period (30 seconds)
  3. Check your email again following the steps above
</div>

## Alternative Authentication Methods

<div data-tone="plain">
  If email delivery continues to fail, consider these alternatives:
</div>

### Magic Links

<div data-tone="plain">
  Instead of entering a 6-digit code, you can use a secure login link sent to your email. This method:

  - Works with corporate email systems
  - Doesn't require manual code entry
  - Provides the same security level
  - Has a longer validity period (30 minutes)
</div>

### Different Email Address

<div data-tone="plain">
  If you're using a corporate or restrictive email provider, try:

  - Personal Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook account
  - Email provider with fewer restrictions
  - Alternative domain (if available)
</div>

### SMS Verification (Coming Soon)

<div data-tone="technical">
  SMS verification will be available in future updates, providing an alternative channel for verification codes.
</div>
