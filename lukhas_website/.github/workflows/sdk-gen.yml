            This PR was auto-generated by CI.

            It regenerates the TypeScript SDKs from the latest OpenAPI specs in `proto_openapi/`.

            **Includes:**
            - packages/sdk-identity
            - packages/sdk-wallet
            - packages/sdk-qrg
            - packages/sdk-consent

            Review tip: SDKs are generated code — skim changes and ensure build passes.
