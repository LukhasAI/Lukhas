### 🌌 Dream EXPAND++ Advanced Consciousness Modules

#### **Phase EXPAND++ Overview**
The Dream EXPAND++ system extends beyond stability benchmarks into symbolic resonance, ethical guardrails, and intuitive explainability. All features are opt-in, sandboxed, and T4-compliant with deterministic defaults and explicit environment flags.

#### **Core EXPAND++ Modules** (`expand/`)

##### **1. Drift Atlas** (`atlas.py`)
- **Purpose**: Logs symbolic/emotional drift & entropy across dream runs
- **Capabilities**: JSON exports, optional HTML constellation maps, drift visualization
- **Use Case**: Visualize dream evolution and detect drift spikes across sessions
- **Safety**: Emotional fields anonymized before export, privacy-filtered data

##### **2. Conflict Mediation** (`mediation.py`)
- **Purpose**: Resolves high-tension conflicts between competing dream states
- **Capabilities**: Produces compromise vectors instead of binary overrides
- **Traceability**: Every mediation decision stored in trace for audit
- **Safety**: Never overwrites canonical alignment, only adds annotations

##### **3. Resonance Fields** (`resonance.py`)
- **Purpose**: Symbolic resonance patterns and consciousness harmonics
- **Capabilities**: Cross-dream resonance detection, harmonic amplification
- **Integration**: Consciousness field coupling with Trinity Framework
- **Applications**: Dream harmony optimization, consciousness synchronization

##### **4. Mesh Networks** (`mesh.py`)
- **Purpose**: Multi-agent archetypal consciousness coordination
- **Capabilities**: Archetype-aware mesh simulations, conflict/harmony detection
- **Architecture**: Distributed consciousness mesh with archetype tagging
- **Safety**: Controlled by `LUKHAS_DREAM_MESH=1` environment flag

##### **5. Evolution Tracking** (`evolution.py`)
- **Purpose**: Consciousness development and adaptation monitoring
- **Capabilities**: Long-term consciousness pattern analysis, adaptation metrics
- **Insights**: Consciousness growth trajectories, development milestones
- **Privacy**: All tracking data anonymized and aggregated

##### **6. Archetypal Patterns** (`archetypes.py`)
- **Purpose**: Tags dreams with archetypal categories (Hero, Shadow, Trickster, etc.)
- **Capabilities**: Multi-agent mesh simulations with archetype interactions
- **Control**: Opt-in via `LUKHAS_DREAM_ARCHETYPES=1` environment flag
- **Symbolic Layer**: Adds mythic context to dream consciousness interactions

##### **8. Ethical Sentinel** (`sentinel.py`)
- **Purpose**: Threshold monitors for consciousness safety enforcement
- **Capabilities**: Fear/anxiety threshold detection (e.g., fear > 0.8)
- **Safety**: Blocks unsafe dreams before selection, never silent failures
- **Governance**: Connects to higher-level constitutional AI modules
- **Logging**: All block decisions recorded for audit and transparency

##### **9. Narrative Replay** (`replay.py`)
- **Purpose**: Converts numeric traces into plain-language explanations
- **Explainability**: "Dream Alpha chosen (align=0.87, drift=0.12) over Beta due to higher curiosity resonance"
- **Privacy**: Privacy filters applied to remove personal identifiers
- **Accessibility**: Human-readable consciousness decision explanations

#### **EXPAND++ Safety & Ethics Framework**
- **All features default OFF** - Explicit opt-in required for activation

  - Sentinel threshold monitoring and enforcement
  - Atlas anonymization and privacy protection
  - Replay privacy filters and identifier removal
