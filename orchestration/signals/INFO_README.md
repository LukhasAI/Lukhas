# Signal Orchestration — INFO

Purpose: Endocrine‑inspired signaling (Signal Bus, Homeostasis, Prompt Modulator) that turns world events into safe, adaptive API parameters and prompt styles.

User features
- Stable responses under stress/urgency via homeostasis
- Automatic clarification for ambiguity
- Style adaptation (strict/balanced/creative)

Advantages
- Transparent parameter derivation with auditability
- Prevents oscillations and rate spikes

Goals & objectives
- Be the single source of truth for API tuning
- Emit metadata to explain decisions

Why this system
- Safety and UX consistency rely on principled modulation

Roadmap linkages
- Feeds bridge/llm_wrappers
- Will plug into Guardian feedback and memory retrieval
