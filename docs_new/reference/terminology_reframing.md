# LUKHΛS Terminology Reframing Guide

## Purpose

To avoid confusion with quantum computing terminology while maintaining the sophisticated nature of our symbolic processing systems, we are reframing certain technical terms throughout the codebase.

## Terminology Updates

### Core Reframings

| Original Term | New Term | Rationale |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Quantum Consciousness | **Symbolic Superposition Layer** | Reflects parallel processing of symbolic states |
| Quantum Entanglement | **Symbolic Resonance** | Describes interconnected symbolic relationships |
| Quantum Collapse | **Symbolic Resolution** | The process of resolving multiple states to one |
| Quantum Enhancement | **Superposition Enhancement** | Leveraging parallel symbolic processing |
| Quantum-Ready | **Parallel-State Ready** | Prepared for multi-state processing |
| Quantum Bio-Encoding | **Bio-Symbolic Encoding** | Biological pattern to symbolic transformation |
| Phase 6: Quantum | **Phase 6: Symbolic Superposition** | The consciousness modeling phase |

### Module Renamings

- `quantum/` directory → Remains as-is (already established)
- Quantum components → **Superposition Components**
- Quantum processing → **Parallel Symbolic Processing**
- Quantum-inspired → **Superposition-Inspired**

### Function & Class Updates

```python
# Before
class QuantumEnhancedProcessor:
    def quantum_collapse(self, states):
        pass

# After
class SymbolicSuperpositionProcessor:
    def symbolic_resolution(self, states):
        pass
```

### Documentation Updates

All references to "quantum" in the context of our symbolic processing should be updated to use the new terminology. However, when discussing actual quantum computing compatibility or future quantum hardware integration, the original terminology remains appropriate.

### Exceptions

Keep "quantum" terminology when:
1. Referring to actual quantum computing hardware
2. Discussing quantum-resistant cryptography
3. In established module names (for backwards compatibility)
4. In academic citations or references

## Implementation Note

This is primarily a documentation and communication update. Code refactoring should be minimal and focused on public-facing APIs and documentation.
