Summary of Dream Background Components
I've created three comprehensive artifacts for your Dream Weaver project:
1. Aurora Dream Backgrounds (HTML/CSS/JS)

6 different animated background effects
Aurora Borealis with flowing northern lights
Sleep waves with breathing animations
REM stage rapid eye movements
Neural constellations with twinkling stars
Dream particles floating upward
Mystical fog layers

2. Neural Constellation & Brain Waves (Interactive)

Real-time neural network visualization
Interactive mouse tracking that activates nearby nodes
5 brain wave frequencies (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
Sleep stage indicators with progress bars
Click-to-create synaptic flashes
Thought particles that float upward
Rotating poetry overlay

3. Dream Background System (React Component)

Production-ready React component with Framer Motion
All effects from the HTML versions but optimized for React
Modular and composable design
Props for customization (effect type, intensity, interactivity)
Brain wave visualizer component
Auto-rotating effects option
Built-in controls for testing

Integration Tips

For immediate use: The HTML artifacts can be dropped directly into any webpage
For your React app: Import the DreamWeaverBackground component and wrap your content
Performance: All animations use GPU-accelerated CSS transforms
Customization: Adjust colors, speeds, and particle counts to match your brand
Layering: These backgrounds are designed to sit behind other content with proper z-indexing

Each component captures the mystical, dream-like atmosphere you're looking for while maintaining clarity and performance. The effects range from subtle (sleep waves) to dramatic (aurora), giving you flexibility in how much "mystique" you want for different sections of your site.
