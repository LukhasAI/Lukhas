# Enterprise Consciousness Features

This directory contains modules related to enterprise-grade features for the LUKHAS Consciousness and Memory systems. These features are designed for environments requiring high levels of security, auditability, and role-based access control.

## Vision

The goal of Enterprise Consciousness is to provide a robust framework for deploying LUKHAS AI in business-critical applications. Key features include:

*   **Advanced Auditing**: Immutable, cryptographic audit trails for all memory and consciousness operations. This allows for detailed forensic analysis and ensures compliance with enterprise policies.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained control over which agents or users can access specific memory folds, namespaces, or consciousness functions. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Data Residency and Governance**: Controls to ensure that memory data is stored in specific geographic locations to comply with data sovereignty regulations.
*   **Federated Learning for Memory**: Mechanisms for multiple LUKHAS instances to learn from each other's memories without sharing the raw data, preserving privacy and security.
*   **High-Availability and Disaster Recovery**: Enterprise-grade reliability features to ensure the consciousness system is always available and can recover from failures with minimal data loss.
*   **Integration with Enterprise Security Systems**: Connectors for integrating with enterprise identity providers (e.g., SAML, OAuth), key management systems (e.g., HSMs), and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
