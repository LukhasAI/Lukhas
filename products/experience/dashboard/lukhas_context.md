### Dashboard Integration Patterns

#### **Constellation Framework (8 Stars) Dashboard Integration**
```
Dashboard UI ←→ Consciousness 🧠 ←→ Memory 💾 ←→ Identity ⚛️
      │                │              │              │
 User Interface ← Decision → Memory ← User
      │           Display     Access     Authentication
      │                │              │              │
 Personalization ← Consciousness → History ← Profile
                    Interaction    Display    Management
```

#### **User Experience Flow**
```
User Authentication → Dashboard Loading → Personalized Experience
         │                    │                   │
   Identity → Interface → AGI
   Verification    Generation    Interaction
         │                    │                   │
   User Profile → Dashboard → System
         │        Customization    Monitoring
         │                    │                   │
   Preferences → Real-Time → Analytics
                   Updates       Display
```
